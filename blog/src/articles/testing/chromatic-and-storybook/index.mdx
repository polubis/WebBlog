description: The process of creating small components library supported by chromatic and storybook.
readTime: 10
title: Chromatic and storybook
---

<Prelude>
  <M>
    I don't know about you, but I like creating components - especially the more
    advanced ones.
  </M>
  <M>
    If you write a component library yourself, and you have a small number of
    components - testing is not problematic, and documentation is not needed.
  </M>
  <M>
    However, if you have much more components and they will be used by other
    developers - you have a problem.
  </M>
  <M>
    That's why such technologies as <B>chromatic</B> and <B>storybook</B> were
    created, which you will learn now.
  </M>
</Prelude>

<Section>
  <XL>1. Creating example project</XL>
  <M>
    Demonstrating these technologies makes no sense without a project. Here I
    will use a typical React project generated from this{" "}
    <A outside href="https://github.com/polubis/CRA-TEMPLATE">
      repository template
    </A>
    .
  </M>
</Section>

<Section>
  <XL>2. Storybook</XL>
  <M>
    Technology that gives you a separate development environment, playground for
    components, automatic documentation and cool tools for debugging. In simple
    words - just take all of your components and render them in another app
    separately.
  </M>

  />
  <Hint hasBg>
    <B>Storybook</B> is not reserved only for React. Check the{" "}
    <A
      href="https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/get-started/introduction"
      outside
    >
      docs
    </A>{" "}
    for more information.
  </Hint>
</Section>

<Section>
  <XL>3. Adding storybook to project</XL>
  <M>
    It's very simple. Be sure that you are in the root directory of the project.
    Then all you need to do is type commands described in{" "}
    <A href="https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/get-started/install" outside>
      docs
    </A>
    . Just run <B>npx storybook init</B> and wait until process end.
  </M>
  <M>
    When files are generated - run <B>npm run storybook</B>. This command will
    run <B>storybook environment</B> and you can start the real fun.
  </M>

    The script can ask you about migration to <B>npm7</B> if you are using{" "}
    <B>npm8</B> or higher - just confirm that.

<Section>
  <XL>4. Removing generated stories</XL>
  <M>
    In our case, we need to document real components which we are using in our
    small app. So let's remove <B>src/stories</B> directory.

<Section>
  <XL>5. Adding first story</XL>
  <M>
    Let's add story for <B>InputField</B> component. As you can see, it's a
    pretty small amount of code to get nice documentation and be able to play
    with it while developing without any need to run the full app.

  <XL>6. Chromatic</XL>
  <M>
    When you have <B>storybook</B> - you can use <B>chromatic</B>. Now the magic
    starts. <B>Chromatic</B> it's a game changer. This technology takes your
    components with stories and builds them into an automatically deployed web
    app.
  </M>
  <M>
    You can trigger the build manually or perform it on the pipeline after
    merging or creating a pull request to a dedicated branch.
  </M>
  <M>
    The best feature is an option to compare how your components look between
    different code versions. <B>Chromatic</B> detects that and draws differences
    for you in UI. The code change is displayed as well.
  </M>

    description="Life is great now"
  />
  <M>
    The code that impacts the look of the components is marked with yellow
    bullets. After that, you need to go and accept or reject this change. This
    is a great job for <B>project owner</B>.

<Section>
  <XL>7. Chromatic configuration</XL>
  <M>
    Just go to{" "}
    <A href="https://www.chromatic.com" outside>
      chromatic
    </A>{" "}
    and log in via your source control provider.
  </M>
  <M>
    Now create <B>chromatic</B> project via choosing repository. A token will be
    generated. Type <B>npm install --save-dev chromatic</B> in terminal. After
    this push your commit via <B>git push</B> and type{" "}
    <B>npx chromatic --project-token=YOUR_TOKEN</B> - this create the first
    build.
  </M>
  <M>
    The script will ask you to add the build script into <B>package.json</B>{" "}
    file - just confirm that.

<Section>
  <XL>8. Detecting first changes</XL>
  <M>
    Now you need to change the implementation of the component that indicates
    changes in UI. After that just type <B>npm run chromatic</B> to trigger a
    new snapshot build and check changes.
  </M>
  <M>
    If changes are found you need to review them and accept them. Without this,
    it will always compare with the previously accepted version of the build :).

  <XL>9. Last improvements</XL>
  <M>
    In this step we remove <B>build-storybook.log</B> from repo. Just add that
    file name to <B>.gitignore</B>.
  </M>
  <M>
    Also, you need to remove the project token from the source repository and
    use it from <B>.env</B> files as documentation recommends. Also, we can
    achieve that by <B>secrets</B>. I prefer this approach.
  </M>

  <M>
    After that remove{" "}
    <B>"chromatic": "npx chromatic --project-token=YOUR_TOKEN"</B> from{" "}
    <B>package.json</B> - it's not needed. Soon you will run your builds
    automatically.

  <XL>10. Integrating with pipeline</XL>
  <M>
    Let's trigger our builds on PR to the main branch. So current workflow will
    be:
  </M>
  <List items="Developer changes implementation, PR is raised to main, Chromatic builds components and requests review, Review is accepted -> you can merge into main" />
  <M>
    Of course, the process can be aligned with your project. This is just the
    simplest one.
  </M>
  <M>
    To achieve that, we need to add pipeline configuration to the repository.
  </M>

  />
  <M>
    It should be added under <B>.github/workflows</B>. Now to test that follow
    the steps below:
  </M>
  <List items="Create a new branch from main, Change component implementation which indicates UI, Raises PR to main, Check is build created" />
