title: State management with rxjs in React
---

<Prelude>
  <M>
    In React world, changes on UI are caused by state changing inside your
    components. To simplify, we can say that state is equal to UI.
  </M>
  <M>
    Everything looks very easy if you have simple features. In more advanced
    ones or in a bigger application, state management can cause headaches. If
    you implement it in a wrong way, it can lead to huge problems with
    maintenance later.
  </M>
  <M>
    Let's check how we can achieve nice and clean state management with rxjs and
    ContextAPI.
  </M>
  <Hint hasBg>Yup, I know we have redux/FLUX and other stuff ðŸ‘½.</Hint>
</Prelude>

<Section>
  <XL>1. State/logic outside component</XL>
  <M>
    Firstly, you need to move state management logic outside of React ecosystem.
    I know it may sound strange but trust me. With this approach you will have:
  </M>
  <List items="Independent testing, Reusability, Option to easy migrate to other technology, Easy to replace the logic" />
  <M>
    Multi-layered architecture is an investment. Of course, initially, it takes
    more time to implement something but later it saves a lot of your time if
    it's not too complicated.
  </M>
  <Snippet

    linesCount={28}
    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polubis/State-management-with-RxJs-in-React/main/src/snippets/simple-store.tsx"
  />
  <M>
    Right now, we have the first layer which is responsible for the creation of
    store objects with public API. This API allows us to change the state and
    notify all subscribers.
  </M>
</Section>

<Section>
  <XL>2. Usage in React component</XL>
  <M>
    In React we need to use two hooks to connect our module with the functional
    component. With <B>useMemo()</B> we create only one instance of <B>store</B>{" "}
    object per component's life cycle. With <B>useEffect()</B> we update the
    state based on the signals from our module store and this triggers rerender.
  </M>
  <Snippet

    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polubis/State-management-with-RxJs-in-React/main/src/snippets/usage-in-component.tsx"
  />
  <M>
    This approach gives us the full power of rxjs. Right now, we can use the
    operator to handle side effects and other complicated logic.
  </M>
</Section>

<Section>
  <XL>3. Sharing state without ContextAPI</XL>
  <M>
    You can share created store inside components via simple imports statements
    between files. This gives you the same behavior as with redux without tons
    of boilerplate. As in redux you will need to reset the state if needed.
  </M>
  <Snippet

    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polubis/State-management-with-RxJs-in-React/main/src/snippets/sharing-state-without-context-api.tsx"
  />
</Section>

<Section>
  <XL>4. Usage with ContextAPI</XL>
  <M>
    This approach gives you full encapsulation and connection with React
    ecosystem. Right now, there is no need to reset the state. You determine in
    components where dedicated store API can be exposed in the component tree.
  </M>
  <Snippet
    description="ContextAPI implementation"
    linesCount={38}
    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polubis/State-management-with-RxJs-in-React/main/src/snippets/sharing-state-with-context-api.tsx"
  />
  <M>
    As you probably noticed we're exposing a dedicated hook to hide Context
    details.
  </M>
  <Snippet

    linesCount={31}
    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polubis/State-management-with-RxJs-in-React/main/src/snippets/consuming-shared-context-state.tsx"
  />
  <M>
    Now, you have two options. You can implement state management with or
    without ContextAPI. It depends on your needs.
  </M>
</Section>

<Section>
  <XL>5. Let's create a consistent API</XL>
  <M>
    Of course, we can manually write this code for every feature, but it's a bit
    frustrating and time consuming. In addition, we can make some mistakes or
    provide different APIs. To avoid this problem we need abstraction.
  </M>
  <M>
    Firstly, lets create <B>createStore()</B> function which allows us to create
    store object.
  </M>
  <Snippet
    description="Factory method"
    linesCount={50}
    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polubis/State-management-with-RxJs-in-React/main/src/framework/createStore.ts"
  />
  <M>
    Next, we need a hook which reduces boilerplate and connects us to React
    ecosystem.
  </M>
  <Snippet
    description="Hook for connection with React"
    linesCount={19}
    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polubis/State-management-with-RxJs-in-React/main/src/framework/useStore.tsx"
  />
  <M>
    Lastly, a function that creates a full feature and adds ContextAPI support.
    This function will return the wrapper component and hook to consume provided
    API in the component tree.
  </M>
  <Snippet
    description="Connection with ContextAPI"
    linesCount={70}
    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polubis/State-management-with-RxJs-in-React/main/src/framework/createContextStore.tsx"
  />
  <M>
    Let's construct ContextAPI provider and hook for reading state/performing
    actions.
  </M>

    linesCount={9}
    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polubis/State-management-with-RxJs-in-React/main/src/final/ChatProvider.tsx"
  />
  <M>Right now you can use it in an easy way inside the component.</M>
  <Snippet
    description="Usage"

<Summary>
  <M>
    I hope you enjoyed this article. Now you are able to use rxjs in your
    projects. From my point of view, it works really well. It's lightweight and
    scalable, and you can customize it for your needs.
  </M>
  <M>
    Remember, the solution which you should use depends on the project's
    specification.
