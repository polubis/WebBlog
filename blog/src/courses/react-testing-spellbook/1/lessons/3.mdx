  <XL>We are converting the syntax</XL>
  <M>
    There is very little left to write our first tests. Let's convert one of the
    features created earlier into something the computer can understand.
    Typically, most testing tools use blocks <B>describe</B> and <B>it</B> to
    describe tests. <B>Describe</B> means functionality, and <B>it</B> means a
    specific test. Thus, for the functionality of pizza making, we will make the
    following transformation:
  </M>
  <Snippet description="For humans">
    {`
Feature: Our friend knows how to make a pizza.
1. Is the pizza size between 30 cm and 34 cm?
2. Is the cake brown?
3. Is the cheese melted?
4. Is the pizza warm?
5. Isn't the pizza plate dirty?
6. Did the pizza taste good for 90% customers?
   `}
  </Snippet>
  <Snippet description="For computers">
    {`
describe("Our friend knows how to make a pizza", () => {
  it("Pizza size is between 30cm and 40 cm", () => {});
 
  it("Cake is brown", () => {});
 
  it("Cheese is melted", () => {});
   
  it("Pizza is warm", () => {});
   
  it("Pizza plate is clean", () => {}); // We changed it to a shorter form without negation.
   
  it("Pizza tastes good to 90% of customers", () => {});
});
    `}
  </Snippet>
  <M>
    Note that we have moved from questions to assertions. The reason is simple -
    less text is produced and it is more intuitive to read. Also, if it is
    possible to simplify an assertion to a shorter form, it is worth doing so{" "}
    <B>(see Pizza plate is clean)</B>.
