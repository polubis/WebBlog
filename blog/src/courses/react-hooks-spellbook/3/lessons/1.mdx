  <XL>Why?</XL>
  <M>
    Information about the scroll position of the window object is often useful
    during implementation of cool widgets.
  </M>
  <M>
    Instead of comparing at the level of components - you can get a result right
    away, which will simply describe to you what position the scroll is
    currently in.
