  <XL>Why?</XL>
  <M>
    Sometimes you want to render components outside <B>div</B> with{" "}
    <B>id="root"</B>. It may happen when you're working on some components that
    use <B>z-index</B> or <B>absolute/fixed/static</B> positions in css - these
    could be modals, alerts or prompts.
  </M>
  <M>
    This can be achieved by usage of <B>React.createPortal()</B>. Remember{" "}
    <B>don't repeat yourself</B>. Don't use this API everywhere and stop copying
    the logic all the time. It's a good idea to create a hook for that.
