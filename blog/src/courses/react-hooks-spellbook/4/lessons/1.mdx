  <XL>Why?</XL>
  <M>
    Authorization is one of the most repetitive things in an application. The
    logic of it varies depending on what we use for authorization.
  </M>
  <M>
    Suppose you have three methods of authorization - <B>Google</B>,{" "}
    <B>Facebook</B> and the <B>usual login form</B>. For the application, it
    should make no difference what kind of provider it is. So we need an
    abstraction that will give the application all the tools to authorize with
    any provider.
