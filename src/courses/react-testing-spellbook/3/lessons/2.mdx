  <M>
    In the above mentioned article, we covered the basics of{" "}
    <B>integration testing</B>. The conclusion at the end was:{" "}
    <B>"How we can remove implementation details leak from our tests?"</B>. I
    proposed a library that is called{" "}
    <A href="https://mswjs.io/" outside>
      msw - mock service worker
    </A>
    , so right now we will integrate our test environment with this technology and
    we'll remove implementation details from our test suites.{" "}

<Section>
  <XL>What the hell is a mock service worker library?</XL>
  <M>
    This technology allows us to run <B>Node</B> process in the background that
    intercepts <B>HTTP requests</B> and allows us to override responses for
    specific endpoints. We can add custom logic, static <B>JSON</B> responses,
    and whatever we want. It can be understood as a <B>middleware</B> between
    your <B>application/testing environment</B> and <B>HTTP</B> layer.
  </M>
  <M>The most popular use cases are: </M>
  <L>
    <Li>mocking responses for integration tests,</Li>
    <Li>
      mocking responses for backend endpoints during local development, it's a
      situation when backend devs still work on some endpoint, but it's not
      finished yet.
    </Li>
  </L>
  <Hint hasBg>
    If you know the <B>service workers</B> concept from <B>PWA</B>, the{" "}
    <B>msw</B> is something similar but designed for different use case -
    mocking stuff for development purposes.

<Section>
  <XL>The configuration of MSW</XL>
  <M>
    It's really simple, first of all, we need to install the package <B>msw</B>.
    Open the terminal and run the following command:{" "}
    <B>npm i --save-dev msw</B>.
  </M>
  <M>
    Keep notice that the <B>package</B> should be installed as{" "}
    <B>developer dependency</B>. It's because we'll use it only for development
    purposes!
  </M>
  <Hint hasBg>
    I'll skip the demonstration of how it works in a real, opened application.
    This <B>lesson</B> is about testing. So, let's dive into configuration for
    testing.{" "}

  />
  <M>
    That's all what is needed for configuration or <B>msw</B>, other code needs
    to be applied in test suites.{" "}

<Section>
  <XL>Using MSW in tests</XL>
  <M>
    I will say it at the beginning - the code for using <B>msw</B> in tests will
    be mostly repeated - it requires some boilerplate. It's the best case for
    using the <B>fixture pattern</B>.
  </M>
  <Hint hasBg>
    If you are not familiar with <B>fixtures</B> I recommend to read the
    following{" "}

      href="/courses/react-testing-spellbook/mastering-unit-testing/creating-testing-fixtures/"
    >

    </A>{" "}
    article.
  </Hint>
  <M>
    Now, let's create a <B>fixture</B> that will allow our <B>testing code</B>{" "}
    to set and get what will be needed for our test logic.

  />
  <M>
    Now when we want to use <B>msw</B> interception in test suites, we'll need
    to import the above created <B>fixture</B> and we'll use it in the following
    way:{" "}

  />
  <M>
    We have overridden a default mock from <B>server.ts</B> file. Next, we added
    some boilerplate connected with starting, mocking, and closing the{" "}
    <B>Node</B> process - it will be required in every test file. Lastly, if you
    have <B>default</B> mocks in <B>server</B> setup file (the one that we
    created at the beginning), I recommend to be careful - your test code may be
    harder to read, but u2y.

    It's time to remove ugly implementation details with <B>msw</B>.

  <M>A little summary: </M>
  <L>
    <Li>we removed service layer mocks,</Li>
    <Li>no more implementation details,</Li>
    <Li>no more need for ugly "jest.requireActual" usage,</Li>
    <Li>
      if the implementation of service layer change - we don't care anymore,
      test will work correctly and will not return "false negatives".
    </Li>
  </L>
</Section>

<Summary label="Concerns and results of our refactor">
  <M>
    That was a good <B>refactor</B>... We made our tests less fragile to
    implementation change in our <B>service</B> layer - <B>HTTP logic</B>.{" "}
  </M>
  <M>
    However, we still have some <B>boilerplate</B> that needs to be added and
    repeated across different tests... Good news! It's fixable and we'll cover
    it in the next article.
