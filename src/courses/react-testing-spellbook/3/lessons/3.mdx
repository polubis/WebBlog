<M>In the previous lesson, we added <B>MSW</B> library to our setup and we refactored our integration tests. At the end of the lesson, we came to the conclusion: "Holly cow, so much boilerplate is produced in every test suite...".
Just look at the following example: </M>
<Code
mode="dynamic"
rolled
lang="tsx"

linesCount={54}
description="Almost 10 lines required to start testing"
/>

<M>We can improve it with a simple <B>fixture</B> pattern. We need a function that allows us to mock any endpoint in an easy way.</M>

  <Section>
  <XL>Let's design a "serverFixture" API</XL>
  <M>Let's first check what we have now. </M>
  <Code
mode="dynamic"
lang="tsx"
description="The current approach that we want to refactor"
src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polubis/Dream-stack-for-React-dev/lesson/Creating-fixture-for-MSW-to-reduce-boilerplate-and-setup/2.tsx"

  <M>
    Our new API should be simple, should reduce the boilerplate, and should be flexible. 
  </M>
  <Code
mode="dynamic"
lang="tsx"
description="This is the new API proposal"

/>

<M>We'll have less code - that's obvious and we don't need to remember using all of these <B>reset</B> and <B>setup</B> functions in <B>before</B> and <B>after</B> callbacks - forgetting them may cause unexpected issues and they are hard to spot for not experienced developers.</M>
<M>Also, we removed the need to use <B>server.use</B> wrap, which may be also forgotten. </M>

  <XL>Implementing the "serverFixture" function</XL>
  <M>
   The first thing that may be weird is the following code:
  </M>
  <Code
mode="dynamic"
lang="tsx"
src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polubis/Dream-stack-for-React-dev/lesson/Creating-fixture-for-MSW-to-reduce-boilerplate-and-setup/4.tsx"
linesCount={1}
/>
  <M>Why do we need to pass <B>beforeAll, afterEach</B> and <B>afterAll</B> callbacks?</M>
  <M>It's because, in the testing environment, our <B>fixture</B> function will not have access to <B>jest</B> environment. So, we need to pass these functions as a parameter and call them inside our util.  Check the <B>GIF</B> to understand: </M>
  <Img
  src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polubis/Dream-stack-for-React-dev/lesson/Creating-fixture-for-MSW-to-reduce-boilerplate-and-setup/1.gif"
  description="Jest functions can be accessed only in test.ts files"
/>
<M>Why it's like that? It's because if you use these functions in your regular code you'll add them to the bundle...</M>
<M>This is the perfect use case for <B>dependency injection</B> pattern and <B>currying technique</B>. Instead of using globally available functions from <B>jest</B>, we'll pass them inside to <B>fixture</B> via parameter.</M>

<M>Let's add the required <B>boilerplate</B> and prepare some <B>types</B>.</M>

<M>Now, we need to create a file with types. </M>
<Code

lang="tsx"

linesCount={9}
/>
<M>Okay, now the code is working. We need to add the last part - the <B>mock</B> function that will truly add mocks to the dedicated endpoint. The <B>mock</B> function will have the following signature.</M>
<Code
mode="dynamic"
lang="tsx"

<M>The last part - we need to align the implementation!</M>

  <M>
    You don't need to worry about that. The <B>jest</B> will call{" "}
    <B>beforeAll</B> twice. In your testing code and internally inside the{" "}
    <B>serverFixture</B> function!

<Summary label="Conclusions and thoughts">
  <M>
    We reduced the amount of boilerplate, and things to remember and we added
    reusable <B>fixture</B> for mocking <B>server endpoints</B>. Writting
    integration tests right now it's not a guilty pleasure anymore...
