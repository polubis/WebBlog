  <M>
    An <B>integration test</B> is a type of software testing that focuses on
    evaluating the interactions and interdependencies between different{" "}
    <B>components</B> or <B>modules</B> of a software application. The primary
    goal of integration testing is to ensure that these individual parts of the
    software work together <B>correctly as a whole</B>, rather than just testing
    them <B>in isolation</B>.
  </M>
  <M>
    Here are some <B>key points</B> to help you understand integration testing:
  </M>
  <L>
    <Li>
      interaction points - communication of the modules, where it happens, how
      it happens,
    </Li>
    <Li>scope - the part of the feature to check,</Li>
    <Li>
      testing real-world scenarios - integration tests verify business cases,
      flows, whole or part of the program,
    </Li>
    <Li>
      stubs and mocks - like in unit tests they may require stubs and mocks,
    </Li>
    <Li>
      identification of issues - they should try to detect a real
      business/complete feature problems.
    </Li>

  <XL>Understanding the feature</XL>
  <M>
    Before you start writing <B>integration tests</B> you need to understand the{" "}
    <B>whole</B> or <B>part</B> of the feature that you want to cover. Without
    this is really hard to write bulletproof tests that will give you real value
    (will detect problems in your modules communication that may break your
    feature).
  </M>
  <M>
    So, let's introduce our feature - <B>the sign-in </B> one.{" "}
  </M>
  <Hint hasBg>
    Yea, again this repetitive concept but it's really great to show how{" "}
    <B>integration tests</B> work.

  <M>
    Let's forget about implementation and focus on parts that are worthy to
    cover.
  </M>
  <L ordered>
    <Li>
      Is the loader shown and the submit button is disabled during submission?
    </Li>
    <Li>
      Is an alert with an error displayed when credentials are wrong or another
      server error occurs?
    </Li>
    <Li>Is an alert with success displayed when the user is signed in?</Li>
  </L>
</Section>

<Section>
  <XL>The current implementation of sign-in </XL>
  <M>
    There is no need to deep dive into each module that we're using here - the
    most important part is that we are relying on other modules. In the example
    below, we're using <B>Zustand</B> stores, some <B>actions</B>,{" "}
    <B>presentational components</B>, and simple models.
  </M>
  <Hint hasBg>
    If you want to understand the <B>Zustand</B> a little bit more, I recommend

    It's a typical scenario. The business state is outside of <B>React</B>{" "}
    ecosystem (implemented with <B>Zustand</B>), we have some dummy
    presentational components imported from <B>design system</B> library, and
    we're using <B>custom hooks</B> and other <B>utils</B>.{" "}
  </M>
  <M>
    I skipped the implementation of other modules... Why I did that? Because in{" "}
    <B>integration</B> tests, they should be just <B>black boxes</B> for us. We
    shouldn't know "how they are implemented", but we need to focus on what are
    they offering to our consumer code - in this example <B>SignInForm</B>{" "}
    component.
  </M>
</Section>

<Section>
  <XL>Breaking the walls - let's write the first integration test</XL>
  <M>
    We know less or more how our feature works, what stuff is worthy of
    covering, and how our <B>sign-in</B> form is implemented. Now it's time to
    write well-defined <B>integration tests</B> for the <B>SignInForm</B>{" "}
    component.
  </M>
  <M>
    Let's start from defining <B>describe</B> and <B>it</B> blocks.{" "}
  </M>
  <Code
    mode="static"
    lang="tsx"
  >{`describe('User can use form to sign in when: ', () => {
  it('goes through success flow', async () => {
    // Our test code will go here.
  });
 
  it('goes through failure flow', async () => {
    // Our test code will go here.
  });
});
`}</Code>
  <M>
    We defined 3 cases to cover, but why do we add only 2 scenarios? It's
    because we'll check the <B>disable of button</B> during <B>success</B> flow
    and <B>failure</B> flow. They are different user journeys! So, separating
    this check into separate suites may not detect the issue for a particular
    journey - the button will be disabled only when submitting in success flow,
    but won't be disabled in failure one.
  </M>
  <M>
    Now, we'll start from the integration test that verifies <B>success</B> flow
    and checks whether the <B>button</B> is disabled or not.{" "}
  </M>
  <Code
    mode="static"
    description="Naive integration test"
    lang="tsx"
  >{`describe('User can use form to sign in when: ', () => {
  const LOGIN = 'tom19944';
  const PASSWORD = 'my-password-1994';
 
  it('goes through success flow', async () => {
    render(<SignInForm />);
    // Initially, our button should be disabled - nothing happened yet.
    expect(screen.getByText(/Confirm/).closest('button').disabled).toBeFalsy();
 
    // Populating fields with data and submitting.
    fireEvent.change(screen.getByPlaceholderText('Login*'), {
      target: { value: LOGIN },
    });
    fireEvent.change(screen.getByPlaceholderText('Password*'), {
      target: { value: PASSWORD },
    });
    fireEvent.click(screen.getByText(/Confirm/));
 
    // Checking if the fields have been populated.
    screen.getByDisplayValue(LOGIN);
    screen.getByDisplayValue(PASSWORD);
    // Checking the button disabled status.
    expect(screen.getByText(/Confirm/).closest('button').disabled).toBeTruthy();
  });
});`}</Code>
  <M>There are 2 problems with our test: </M>
  <L ordered>
    <Li>we're not checking the alert message occurrence,</Li>
    <Li>under the hood the is a real HTTP request call.</Li>
  </L>
</Section>

<Section>
  <XL>Mocking the HTTP service layer</XL>
  <M>
    To understand what I'm talking about we need to review an action code of{" "}
    <B>Zustand</B> store.
  </M>
  <Code mode="static" lang="ts">{`import { create } from 'zustand';
import { getError, signIn } from '@system/blog-api';
import type { SignInStore } from './defs';
 
const useSignInStore = create<SignInStore>((set) => ({
  key: 'idle',
  error: null,
  signIn: async (payload) => {
    set({ key: 'pending' });
 
    try {
      // Here is a real request!
      await signIn(payload);
 
      set({ key: 'ok' });
    } catch (error: unknown) {
      set({ key: 'error', error: getError(error) });
    }
  },
}));
`}</Code>
  <M>
    To avoid <B>HTTP</B> request we need to mock the entire{" "}
    <B>@system/blog-api</B> module. It's not perfect, I know, and how we can
    improve that will be explained in the next lesson. Right now, let's just
    finish our test suites to understand the basics.

  <XL>Making sure that tests are working</XL>

    It's the best part of software testing. Try to break your implementation,
    remove some flags, functions, or change their implementation, to be sure
    that your tests spot problems with your code.

<Summary label="Conclusions">
  <M>
    Right now you understand <B>integration tests</B> theory and{" "}

    paths to cover, but there is an important question: Are these tests good?
  </M>
  <M>
    From the perspective of feature covering, they check all important aspects,
    but there are implementation details leak into our tests - a mock of the{" "}
    <B>signIn</B> service function, that's not good.{" "}

    To improve our code we need <B>MSW</B> library, but this topic will be
