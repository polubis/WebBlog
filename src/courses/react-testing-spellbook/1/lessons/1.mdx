  <XL>Question</XL>
  <M>
    Imagine a situation in which you are talking to a powerful AI. It's the year
    2137, and all you have to do is ask a good question.... Exactly, but what
    does good mean?
  </M>
  <M>
    In my opinion, it's a question that is short and specific. The kind you are
    currently asking in the GPT chat room. After all, by asking an overly
    complicated question before you get an answer, you have to ask more
    questions. It is much easier to ask one.
  </M>
  <M>
    Of course, some problems are too complicated to be solved by a single
    question, so the problem should be broken down into smaller parts and to
    each of them ask a simple question - the <B>divide and conquer</B>{" "}
    methodology.
  </M>
  <M>
    That's what software testing is. You should divide the problem if it is
    complicated into <B>n</B> parts, then ask specific questions and find
    answers to them.

  <XL>Answer</XL>
  <M>
    People have been looking for answers forever. It's the same with testing.
    You look for answers to the questions you ask. Is the table flat? Is the
    earth flat? What will be the answers to these questions?
  </M>
  <M>
    Of course, the table is flat, and the earth is not. However, if you go into
    the details, the table is not "perfectly flat" and the earth is not
    perfectly round.{" "}
  </M>
  <M>
    I know I may be approaching this too philosophically, but it is relevant.
    Tests can't 100% guarantee that something works or not, rather they answer a
    specific question.
  </M>
  <M>
    For example, to answer the above questions, the earth is not flat it is
    true, but it is not perfectly round either. As well as the table is flat,
    but it is not perfectly flat. Here you can see the erroneously asked
    question. So the answer was also convoluted. Instead of hearing <B>yes</B>{" "}
    or <B>no</B> in the answer itself I had to resolve the doubts of the
    question....
  </M>
  <M>
    As you can see the answers are dependent on the questions, not vice versa so
    before you start looking for them make sure that the question is the right
    one.

  <XL>Divide and conquer</XL>
  <M>
    Let's suppose you work in a restaurant and teach a colleague to make pizza.
    How do you determine that your friend is making pizza the right way. The
    obvious thing is that you need to ask some questions and find answers to
    them. One question whether the pizza is good asked to the customer is too
    complex ¯\_(ツ)_/¯.
  </M>
  <M>
    So, instead of one, let's ask several of them, but specific ones that will
    give us a result and allow us to decide whether our colleague is a good
    enough pizzerman.
  </M>
  <List items="Is the cake brown?,Is the cheese melted?,Is the pizza warm?,Isn't the pizza plate dirty?,Did the pizza taste good for 90% customers?" />
  <M>
    The answer to each of them is actually yes or no. If all the answers are
    positive, it means that our colleague is "good enough" pizzerman.
  </M>
</Section>

<Section>
  <XL>Well, let's check it</XL>
  <M>
    We already have the questions so let's now look for the answers - let's play
    the role of the tester. Next to each question we will add a corresponding
    icon suggesting yes (✔️) or no (❌).
  </M>
  <List items="Is the cake brown? ✔️,Is the cheese melted? ✔️,Is the pizza warm? ✔️,Isn't the pizza plate dirty? ✔️,Did the pizza taste good for 90% customers? ❌" />
  <M>
    During testing, it turned out that the pizza tasted good to only half of the
    customers, so our colleague needs to train. We gave him a few days and we
    ran the same tests again - because other aspects may be worse{" "}
    <B>(regression)</B>. At the same time, we added another question.
  </M>
  <List
    items="
  Is the pizza size between 30 cm and 34 cm? ✔️,Is the cake brown? ✔️,Is the cheese melted? ✔️,Is the pizza warm? ✔️,Isn't the pizza plate dirty? ✔️,Did the pizza taste good for 90% customers? ✔️"
  />
  <M>
    All questions have a positive answer, so our colleague can start work, and
    you, my dear colleague, already understand the idea of tests and how to
    formulate questions and answer them.
