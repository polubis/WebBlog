name: The best practices for naming tests
duration: 2
description: The nomenclature must be consistent and clear throughout the solution, so we must take care of this from the beginning.

<Prelude>
  <M>
    Imagine a huge project where each developer writes tests descriptions in
    their own way. It will be complete mess. That's why it's a good idea to
    adopt some rules and stick to them from the beginning of the project
  </M>
</Prelude>

<Section>
  <XL>Some consistent rules</XL>
  <M>Take a look at the following example:</M>
  <Code mode="static" lang="ts">
    {`
describe("Pizza meets standards when", () => { 👍
  it("size is between 30-40cm", () => {}); 👍
 
  it("cake is brown", () => {}); 👍
 
  it("cheese is melted", () => {}); 👍
   
  it("cake is warm", () => {}); 👍
   
  it("plate is clean", () => {}); 👍
  
  describe("plate size is equal to", () => {
    it('30cm', () => {}); 👍
    
    it('40cm', () => {}); 👍
  })
});
    `}
  </Code>
  <M>
    We can read the following descriptions as one sentence:{" "}
    <B>Pizza meets standards when size is between 30-40cm</B> or{" "}
    <B>Pizza meets standards when plate size is equal to 30cm</B> (look at
    nested describe block). Thanks to that we are able to read tests as
    documentation and immediately understand the testing case.
  </M>
  <M>We used the following rules to build the above cases:</M>
  <List items="Unattributable words like 'should' or 'correct' are not allowed,Descriptions must be short,Descriptions must use only relevant words that explain the situation,First 'describe' block begins with a capital letter,Every 'it' block begins with a lowercase letter, Nested 'describe' block begins with lowercase letter,There shouldn't be any duplication in test descriptions (use nested 'describe' block as in the example)" />
</Section>

<Summary>
  <M>
    Consistency is very important! If you take care of such things from the
    beginning you will make your project much easier to understand and more
    enjoyable to work with.
