    It's time to look at the tests from a broader perspective. In everyday life,
    we don't deal solely with teaching a colleague how to make a pizza. We can
    also teach him other things - cutting with a knife, cooking pasta, driving a
    car. Each of these topics will have different questions and answers{" "}
    <B>(our tests)</B>. So let's group our functionalities and write the
    appropriate questions for them.

    it's time for some conventions and best practices before we start messing
    around in code.
