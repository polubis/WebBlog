description: What types of tests do we have in software development? Let's understand the impact of unit, integration, and e2e tests.
---

<Prelude>
  <M>
    We grouped our tests into functionalities, and now we need to understand how
    to divide tests by the context that they verify.
  </M>
</Prelude>

<Section>
  <XL>What are the types of tests?</XL>
  <M>
    Taking into account the area we are testing, the test can be divided into
    the following types:{" "}
  </M>
  <L>
    <Li>Unit tests</Li>
    <Li>Integration tests</Li>
    <Li>E2e tests</Li>
  </L>
  <M>
    <B>Unit tests</B> are fast and precise. They are focused on a specific thing
    and answer concrete questions.
  </M>
  <M>In the context of a pizza creation it will be the following situations:</M>
  <Code mode="static" lang="ts">
    {`
describe("Pizza meets standards when", () => {
  // Take a meter and measure this.
  it("size is between 30-40 cm", () => {});
 
  // It's easy to check.
  it("cake is brown", () => {});
 
  // This is visible.
  it("cheese is melted", () => {});
   
  // You can touch cake.
  it("cake is warm", () => {});
   
  // This is visible.
  it("plate is clean", () => {});
});
    `}
  </Code>
  <M>
    <B>Integration tests</B> verifies cooperation. They are also quite fast.
    When we write them, we don't focus on specific things as in unit tests but
    on checking that "something" has been used as intended.
  </M>
  <M>
    Instead of checking if the pizza size, color, and other, we can check if it
    was made according to the recipe in the book. Below is an example of such
    tests:
  </M>
  <Code mode="static" lang="ts">
    {`
describe("Pizza meets standards when", () => {
  // We assume that the recipe contains the necessary steps.
  it("recipe is used from page 31", () => {});
  
  // Instead of verifying the size of the pizza and other 
  // necessary things, we assume that the cook 
  // already "knows" this and he will check it.
  it("the person making the pizza is supervised by the cook", () => {});
});
    `}
  </Code>
  <M>
    <B>E2e tests</B> focus on the user's perspective, not the implementation.
    They are technologically agnostic and usually execute for a long time (they
    operate on the finished application, not code fragments) .
  </M>
  <M>
    Instead of checking what's going on in the kitchen, how the pizza is made
    and based on what recipe - we simply ask the customer what he thinks about
    the taste (the customer is our application).
  </M>
  <Code mode="static" lang="ts">
    {`
describe("Pizza meets standards when", () => {
  it("customer enjoys the taste", () => {});
});
    `}
  </Code>
</Section>

<Summary>
  <M>
    As you might have noticed, mainly the context changes. We started with a
    single employee (code file), we moved to a communication perspective
    (several code files), and at the very end we left the implementation behind
    and simply asked the customer (application) what he thinks about our
    product.
  </M>
  <M>
    That's the difference between the different types of tests. Don't worry, it
    will get into your blood in the next lessons.
