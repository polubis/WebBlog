    During the earlier{" "}

      lesson
    </A>
    , we learned the <B>stubs</B> and realized what they are used for. Now is the
    time for <B>mocks</B>, which are used very often during unit testing.
  </M>
</Prelude>

<Section>
  <XL>Mocks definition</XL>
  <M>
    Mocks are used to replace the implementation of a specific module. Their
    main objective is to provide:
  </M>
  <L>
    <Li>
      Isolation - you can define the expected behavior of the mock and specify
      the responses
    </Li>
    <Li>
      Control - they can simulate different scenarios and edge cases that may be
      challenging to reproduce with real dependencies
    </Li>
    <Li>
      Simplicity - they eliminate the need for complex setups or configurations
      that may be required for using real dependencies
    </Li>
    <Li>
      Performance - mocks can be faster and more efficient than using real
      dependencies
    </Li>
    <Li>
      Testing unavailable or unreliable modules - by mocking module which is
      broken you can test the behavior of your code
    </Li>
  </L>
  <M>Why are mocks so important?</M>
  <M>
    Think of a situation where you make a query to a mailing service in the code
    that you are testing. If you don't mock the API of that service then you're
    making real queries.

<Section>
  <XL>Why do we need to use mocks?</XL>
  <M>
    Let's say we have the following function that is designed to build a path
    for specific article:{" "}
  </M>
  <Code mode="static" lang="ts">{`
  import type { Lang } from 'apps/blog/models';
  
import path from 'path';
  
export const createArticlePath = (lang: Lang, ...rest: string[]): string =>
  path.join(
    process.cwd(),
    'apps',
    'blog',
    'content',
    lang,
    'articles',
    ...rest
  );
  `}</Code>
  <M>
    What catches the eye immediately is the use of the <B>path</B> module and
    the globally available <B>process</B> variable.
  </M>
  <M>
    The path module is not a part of our application, but an external library -
    we assume that it works properly, we don't want to test it.
  </M>
  <M>
    The process variable is an object created by the <B>NodeJS</B> runtime
    environment. It has properties and methods. Also, we have to assume that it
    works correctly and we don't want to test it.
  </M>
  <M>
    How should we test it? We need to mock both and simulate the behavior of the{" "}
    <B>cmd()</B> and <B>join()</B> methods. We know how they work so it won't be
    a problem.
  </M>
</Section>

<Section>
  <XL>Let's mock</XL>
  <M>This is how the <B>join()</B> and <B>cwd()</B> methods work: </M>
  <Code mode="static" lang="ts">{`
path.join('/path/to', 'file.txt');
// Output (on Unix-like systems): /path/to/file.txt
// Output (on Windows): \\path\\to\\file.txt
 
process.cwd()
// Returns current working director - "/home/user/project"
`}</Code>
<M>Now all we need to do is create a test in which we substitute their implementation and check whether our own function works as expected.</M>

<Code mode="static" lang="ts" description="We created two mocks">{`
// This import is essential.
import path from 'path';
 
// This we will test.
import { createArticlePath } from '.';
 
const basePath = 'C:\\Users\\pracapraca\\Dream-stack-for-React-dev\\system';
 
// We replace the implementation of the path module.
jest.mock('path', () => ({
  join: jest.fn(), // Allows methods from "jest" be used.
}));
 
describe('Path for dedicated article is created when', () => {
  // Temp variable.
  const originalCwd = process.cwd;
 
  beforeAll(() => {
    // We replace the cwd method implementation.
    Object.defineProperty(process, 'cwd', {
      value: () => basePath,
      writable: true,
    });
  });
 
  afterAll(() => {
    // We restore the original implementation.
    process.cwd = originalCwd;
  });
   
  it('absolute path is composed', () => {
    // We replace the implementation.
    (path.join as jest.Mock).mockImplementationOnce((...args: string[]) =>
      args.join('\\')
    );
   
    const result = createArticlePath('en', 'my-file.mdx');
   
    // We check that the path is correct.
    expect(result).toBe(
      basePath + '\\apps\\blog\\content\\en\\articles\\my-file.mdx'
    );
  });
});
`}</Code>
<M>In the first mock we replace the implementation of the path module and the join method. Thanks to the <B>jest.fn()</B> we will be able to change the implementation in any other test as needed.</M>
<Code mode="static" lang="ts" description="A way to mock imported modules">{`
// Here we mock module.
jest.mock('path', () => ({
  join: jest.fn(), // This allows us to change the implementation later.
}));
 
// Here we substitute implementations for a specific test.
(path.join as jest.Mock).mockImplementationOnce((...args: string[]) =>
  args.join('\')
);
    `}</Code>
    <M>In the second one, we used <B>defineProperty </B> to override a globally available process object property.</M>
    <Code mode="static" lang="ts" description="A way to mock global objects">{`
// Temp variable.
const originalCwd = process.cwd;
 
// The code in the callback will execute before first test execution.
beforeAll(() => {
  // We replace the cwd method implementation.
  Object.defineProperty(process, 'cwd', {
    value: () => basePath,
    writable: true // Allows to change process.cwd later.
  });
});
 
// The code in the callback will execute after all tests are completed.
afterAll(() => { // It's executed after all tests 
  // We restore the original implementation.
  process.cwd = originalCwd; // This is allowed thanks to writeable: true
});
    `}</Code>
    <M>It is very important to assign a starting value to global objects after testing. If we don't do this, we expose ourselves to side effects and the fact that tests in this file can affect other tests - <B>which is very bad!</B></M>
        <M>Note the use of the <B>object descriptor (writeable: true)</B>, which allowed us to restore to the initial value later. Without this change, it is not possible to overwrite the <B>cwd</B> property implementation.</M>

<Summary>
  <M>
    Bravo! Now you know how important mocks are and how to create them for
    modules, methods and global objects. You have to admit that their use is
    much wider than in the case of stubs.
