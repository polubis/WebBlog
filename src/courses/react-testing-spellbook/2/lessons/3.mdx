<Prelude>

    Let's try to test the behavior of the button component based on the passed
    parameters.
  </M>
</Prelude>

<Section>
  <XL>Understanding tests for React components</XL>
  <M>
    Firstly, we need to create <B>Button</B> component which will be fully
    customizable. We'll use approach called <B>types first</B> - first
    interfaces, implementation later:{' '}
  </M>
  <Code
    mode="dynamic"
    lang="ts"
    src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polubis/Snippets/main/defs.ts'
    linesCount={31}
    description='We mixed native button properties with ours'
  />
  <M>
    Inside <B>consts.ts</B> file we'll store constants. We want to limit options
    for better <B>type-safety</B>.
  </M>
  <Code
    mode="dynamic"
    lang="ts"
    src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polubis/Snippets/main/consts.ts'
    linesCount={6}
    description='You can choose value from 1 to 5, other are unsupported'
  />
  <M>
    Take a look at implementation for <B>Button</B> component:
  </M>
  <Code
    mode="dynamic"
    lang="tsx"
    src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polubis/Snippets/main/button.tsx'
    linesCount={21}
    description='A lot of default properties'
  />
  <M>
    You can choose <B>shape</B>, <B>size</B> and other aspects. This is how it
    looks like in <B>storybook</B>:
  </M>
  <Img src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polubis/Snippets/main/buttons.jpg' />
  <M>
    We need to think before creating the tests. What should be tested? Component
    takes several props and creates <B>className</B> for styling purposes. In
    addition, there are other <B>native</B> button properties injected which
    comes from <B>ButtonProps</B> interface. So it's good to test:{' '}
  </M>
  <List items='Class names creation,Option to pass other properties,Option to pass any children' />
  <M>So let's write first test - the easiest one: </M>
  <Code
    mode="dynamic"
    lang="tsx"
    src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polubis/Snippets/main/button.test.tsx'
    linesCount={12}
    description='Render function used to simulate rendering and HTML nodes creation'
  />
  <M>
    The method <B>getByText</B> allows you to get the HTML node by text. This
    method is using <B>expect</B> inside. If the element is not found - the test
    will not pass (a slight shortening).
  </M>
  <M>
    In React we use <B>jest</B> and <B>react-testing-library</B> on daily basis.
    First one is responsible for faking <B>DOM</B> behavior and test execution.
  </M>
  <M>
    The second one is simple lib that allows you to write tests from{' '}
    <B>user perspective</B>. Instead of searching by <B>id</B> or{' '}
    <B>className</B> we should select by text, role or something what is visible
    for user (placeholder, input value).

  <XL>Adding missing tests</XL>
  <M>Let's add tests for: </M>
  <List items='Class names creation,Option to pass other properties' />
  <Code
    mode="dynamic"
    lang="tsx"
    src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polubis/Snippets/main/button-more.test.tsx'
    linesCount={25}
  />
  <M>
    First test checks <B>implementation details</B>. If we change order of
    classes or we'll add new class - this test will fail. Failure in this case
    doesn't mean bug. It means the order of classes changed. This is called{' '}
    <B>false negative</B> and should be avoided if possible.
  </M>
  <M>
    In second we passed <B>role</B> property to check native button properties
    injection.
  </M>

<Section>
  <XL>Dealing with ugly tests</XL>
  <M>
    How can I fix previous test? You can cover this case with other type of test
    - <B>visual test</B> (we'll explain it in another lesson).
  </M>
  <M>
    Another option is to leave it as it is. In this case you need to remember
    that it may fail and it's <B>fragile</B> to change in implementation.
  </M>
  <Hint hasBg>
    Sometimes you need to test implementation, we'll cover it in next lessons.
  </Hint>
  <M>
    Unfortunately, nothing is perfect. Such a test has value, but it carries
    risks. It's worth to highlight it somehow, so developers won't be surprised
    that the test fails after class names order change. In such situations I
    always add <B>[FRAGILE]</B> before the test description, so later it's easy
    to find these and replace them. After change our fragile test description
    will be:
  </M>
  <Code mode="static" lang="ts">{`it('[FRAGILE] assigns class names by properties')`}</Code>
  <Hint hasBg>
    As a developer you decide which suites are valuable for you. Tests should
    save you from bugs and regression instead of being perfect and pretty. It's
    is not a fashion revue.

    You can find full implementation on this{' '}

    .
  </M>
</Example>

<Summary>
  <M>
    As you saw - React components testing can be tricky. Some areas are hard to
    cover with qualitative <B>unit tests</B>. These areas requires other type of
    tests or practices which we'll cover in next lessons.
