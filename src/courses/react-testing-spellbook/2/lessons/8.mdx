description: Let's understand the common use cases for jest.spy API when testing React and TypeScript code. We'll listen to function calls!

  <M>
    I'm 100% sure that you've had a situation where you needed to pass your
    function as a parameter to another function or React component.
  </M>
  <M>
    How to test such a code? How to verify that after clicking on some UI
    element your function was called with specific parameters and a
    specific/finite number of times? These questions can be answered by{" "}
    <B>spies</B>.

  <M>
    Let's look at the <B>map</B> function written in an earlier{" "}

  <Code
    mode="dynamic"
    lang="ts"
    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polubis/Snippets/main/map.ts"
    linesCount={18}
  />
  <M>We need to write a test that will verify:</M>
  <List items="With what arguments the function was invoked,The number of function calls" />
  <Code
    mode="dynamic"
    lang="ts"
    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polubis/Snippets/main/map-test-with-spy.test.ts"
    linesCount={22}
  />
  <M>
    The statement <B>jest.fn()</B> creates a <B>spy</B> object. Then, with the
    help of the <B>mockImplementation</B> method - we define the implementation
    of the callback passed to the maps.
  </M>
  <M>Then, we check one by one:</M>
  <List items="That the number of callback calls is equal to the number of passed elements,The fact that on each call there were passed sequentially (element | index | array)" />

  <XL>Testing React components with spies</XL>
  <M>
    The situation with testing <B>callbacks</B> passed to{" "}
    <B>React components</B> is almost the same.
  </M>
  <M>
    However, sometimes we need to take into account asynchronicity. Take a look
    at the gif below - we will test such a component.
  </M>
  <Image
    rolled
    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polubis/Snippets/main/circle-gif.gif"
    description="That's our ProgressCircle component"
  />
  <M>We'll be able to call this component in following way: </M>
  <Code mode="static" lang="tsx">{`<ProgressCircle onEnd={() => { console.log('Counting finished!') }} ms={10000} />`}</Code>
  <M>
    After a minimum of <B>10 seconds</B> (because it depends on the load of the
    browser) the callback called <B>onEnd</B> will be called.
  </M>
  <Code
    mode="dynamic"
    lang="tsx"
    linesCount={12}
    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polubis/Snippets/main/progress-circle-spy.test.tsx"
  />
  <M>
    Everything is the same as before except for one change. Namely, we used the
    strange notation <B>await waitFor</B>.{" "}
  </M>
  <M>
    Due to the fact that inside the <B>ProgressCircle</B> component, an interval
    is running every certain period of time, there may be a situation when we
    call <B>expect</B> before the callback <B>onEnd</B> was called. It's because
    intervals in JavaScript are async code.
  </M>
  <M>
    Therefore, using the <B>waitFor</B> call, we will wait a while (about a
    second by default). This time is enough for <B>onEnd</B> to be called and
    will make our test green.

<Summary>
  <M>
    I hope you understood how to test callbacks in different situations. It is
    worth adding that so far it is only half-used. You will see how else you can
    use spies in the next lessons.
