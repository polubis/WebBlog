description: We'll check how we can mock environment variables so that our tests will be always stable.
---

<Prelude>
  <M>
    Sometimes we want to test code that internally uses{" "}
    <B>environment variables</B>. If we do not mock them, our tests may behave
    in an unpredictable way, which we do not want.
  </M>
  <M>
    Imagine that you run code that relies on an environment variable and you
    forget to have it set in the <B>.env</B> file. What will happen?
  </M>
  <M>
    <B>BOOM üí•</B>
  </M>
  <M>
    Just kidding. Simply said, the tests will not pass. What can be done to make
    the tests we run always independent from the environment in which they are
    executed?
  </M>
  <M>
    That's right. We need to <B>mock</B> the global object that our code refers
    to.
  </M>
</Prelude>

<Section>
  <XL>Let's start with an example</XL>
  <M>
    Please look at the following code snippet, in which we try to get a{" "}
    <B>URL</B> to our <B>API</B> with the <B>getUrl</B> function.
  </M>
  <Snippet>
    {`
  // We declare the shape of the global 
// object "process.env".
declare const process: {
  env: {
    NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL?: string;
  };
};
 
const getUrl = () => {
  const url = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL;
 
  // We throw an exception - our code has no right 
  // to work if the variable is missing.
  if (url === undefined) {
    throw Error('Lack of process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL');
  }
 
  return url;
};
 
export { getUrl };`}
  </Snippet>
  <M>
    At the very beginning, we declared the shape of the global object{" "}
    <B>process.env</B> only for the file with our code - outside of it, this
    object will have a default typing. Thanks to this, we limited other
    possibilities of using our variable. The function we created is supposed to
    be the only possible way of accessing the <B>URL</B>.
  </M>
  <M>
    This is how we will get this <B>URL</B> in various files.
  </M>
  <Snippet>
    {`
// This is how we will do.
const url = getUrl(); ‚úîÔ∏è
// That's not how we're going to do it.
const url = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL ‚ùå
    `}
  </Snippet>
  <M>
    As a curiosity, it is worth adding that the used approach, in which we throw
    an exception in the absence of a variable is called <B>fail fast</B>. Code
    without an environment variable won't work anyway, so we throw an{" "}
    <B>exception</B> that immediately points to a potential cause of the
    problem.
  </M>
</Section>

<Section>
  <XL>Let's mock the environment variable!</XL>
  <M>Okay, let's write a test to check:</M>
  <List items="exception throw if there is no variable,variable return if exists" />
  <Snippet>
    {`
    import { getUrl } from './get-url';
    
// This will be the value for our environment variable.
const API_URL = 'https://localhost:3000';
 
describe('Reads API url when: ', () => {
  it('throws exception if lack of env variable', () => {
    // We're reading the current global variable.
    // Then we assign it to a variable.
    const variable = process.env['NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL'];
 
    // We're removing the current global variable.
    delete process.env['NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL'];
 
    // Now our code will throw 
    // an exception - after all, we deleted the variable.
    expect(() => getUrl()).toThrow();
 
    // We're restoring the environment variable. 
    // If we don't do this we can affect other tests!
    process.env['NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL'] = variable;
  });
 
  it('returns readed url', () => {
    const variable = process.env['NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL'];
 
    // Instead of deleting the variable - we overwrite 
    // it with our own
    process.env['NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL'] = API_URL;
 
    expect(getUrl()).toBe(API_URL);
    
    // We also need to restore the starting value.
    process.env['NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL'] = variable;
  });
});
    `}
  </Snippet>
  <M>
    We need to make sure that after modifying the global <B>process</B> object,
    we set the value again to the initial one. Otherwise, we may influence other
    tests. This is standard practice when operating on global objects in tests.
    This also applies to value removal.
  </M>
  <M>
    <B>So what, so that's the end of it?</B>
  </M>
  <M>
    Exactly right. That's all that was needed to mock the object value of the
    environment variable. Let's add a few more minor improvements before we
    finish this lesson.

  <M>
    Since we know that we need to <B>set</B> and <B>reset</B> the value of our{" "}
    <B>global variable</B> - we can use something we've already seen in this
    course. Indeed! <B>Fixtures</B>!
  </M>
  <Hint hasBg>
    You can check how <B>fixtures</B> work in{" "}

  <M>
    So let's create a simple <B>environmentFixture</B> function, that will make
    our tests much <B>prettier</B>.

  const environmentFixture = (key: string) => {
  const initial = process.env[key];
 
  return {
    mock: (value: string) => {
      process.env[key] = value;
    },
    restore: () => {
      process.env[key] = initial;
    },
    delete: () => {
      delete process.env[key];
    },
  };
};
 
describe('Reads API url when: ', () => {
  const API_URL = 'https://localhost:3000';
  const fixture = environmentFixture('NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL');
 
  afterEach(() => {
    // Cleaning after each test automatically.
    fixture.restore();
  });
 
  it('throws exception if lack of env variable', () => {
    fixture.delete();
    expect(() => getUrl()).toThrow();
  });
 
  it('returns readed url', () => {
    fixture.mock(API_URL);
    expect(getUrl()).toBe(API_URL);
  });
});
`}</Snippet>
  <M>
    We encapsulated the repeatable logic in the <B>fixture</B> function.
    Besides, we can use this logic in other tests - simply by creating a
    separate <B>file</B>, and importing it where it's needed.

<Summary>
  <M>
    We've practised mocking environment variables and reuse of logic in tests
    using fixtures. It is worth mentioning that environment variables are not
    the only global objects that we fix in this way. We will discuss this in the
    next lessons.
