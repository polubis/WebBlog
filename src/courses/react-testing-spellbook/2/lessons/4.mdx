<Prelude>
  <M>
    We were able to write some unit tests for <B>Button</B> component in
    previous lesson. What if I tell you that we're able to cover all parts with
    almost 2 lines of testing code? Let's check how snapshot tests works and
    what you can achieve and what you can lose with them.
  </M>
</Prelude>

<Section>
  <XL>Creating snapshot test</XL>
  <M>
    Sometimes if you're writting presentational component you'll produce big{" "}
    <B>DOM</B> tree. How to test such components? You can try to compare
    generated properties with expected ones.
  </M>
  <Code mode="static" lang="tsx">
    {`
const { container } = render(<Button />);
const button = container.queryByClassName()
// We already know that it's fragile test.
// If order of generated classes change - test will cause false negative.
expect(button?.className).toBe(
  'button button-size-2 button-rounded button-outlined button-secondary my-button'
);
    `}
  </Code>
  <M>
    What if you need to verify other properties like <B>style</B> object. It may
    be really complex object, you can check how complex in following{" "}

    . To achieve it fast someone smart invented snapshot testing.
  </M>
  <M>
    Imagine you are playing a computer game and you saved your progress. Bravo!
    It's a snapshot test. Now every time you lose you can start from a safe
    moment.
  </M>
  <M>
    So how it works in <B>jest</B> and <B>React</B>? You need to replace
    previous test with following one:
  </M>
  <Code mode="static" lang="tsx">
    {`
 const { asFragment } = render(<Button />);
// Button is already rendered.
 
// asFragment() creates big string with generated HTML nodes.
// toMatchSnapshot() saves generated string and now it's base for comparision.
expect(asFragment()).toMatchSnapshot();
    `}
  </Code>
  <M>
    When you run <B>test</B> command the <B>__snapshots__</B> directory will be
    generated near your test file. Inside you can find following snapshot
    file:{" "}

  <XL>Truth about snapshot testing</XL>
  <M>
    You may be thinking now - great I will use this new approach everywhere.
    This will be a big mistake ðŸš€. These tests must be used carefully. They're
    easy to write but hard to maintain. They will fail always when something
    change so you need to manually check these changes. They're are useful to
    prevent "any" regression but when overused they cause headaches.{" "}
  </M>
  <M>
    Also, they're much more fragile than previous test with <B>className</B>{" "}
    check. If you change button to span - they will fail. If you add additional
    property to component - they will fail. You need to go through changes and
    check they are valid or not.{" "}
  </M>
  <M>To avoid problems with maintenance create snapshot tests only if: </M>
  <List items="You're sure that something is working correctly,You don't have time for better tests,You're testing complex HTML properties generation,Component is pure presentational" />
  <M>
    A very important point is namely that if our snapshot is saved when the
    component is not working properly, such tests begin to be a problem. You
    need to be careful and focused when using them.
  </M>
  <M>
    To understand what damage they can cause - it is enough to change the
    snapshot of the component at the moment when it works incorrectly, and then
    push these changes to the repository. Good luck with fixing and reviewing
    hundreds and thousands of such tests.
  </M>
  <Hint hasBg>
    I personally use them very rarely. I prefer to have more complex test code,
    and even implementation-dependent, than to rely on something that checks any
    change.

  <XL>How to work with snapshot tests?</XL>
  <M>Check out the list below: </M>
  <List items="Create a component and make sure manually that it works correctly,Create snapshot test to prevent regression,If you will have some time - jump to tests and write concrete ones,You can remove or leave snapshot test as it is (maybe it still covers uncovered paths) - u2y" />
  <M>Look at following test file to understand how I'm using snapshots:</M>
  <Code
    mode="dynamic"
    lang="tsx"
    linesCount={49}
    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polubis/Snippets/main/snapshot-end.test.tsx"
  />

<Summary>
  <M>
    We learned today snapshot tests and how useful/harmful they can be at one
    time. Tests should be reliable, stable and should answer the question -
    whether something works or not, so snapshots should be used with caution.
