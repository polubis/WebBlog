description: Did you again have duplicated the test code? If so, you need fixtures!

<Prelude>
  <M>
    We already know the <B>stubs</B> and the <B>mocks</B> are. There are several
    other concepts worth exploring.
  </M>
  <M>
    Let's see what we can use something that has a strange name - <B>fixture</B>.
  </M>
</Prelude>

<Section>
  <XL>The role of fixture in testing</XL>
  <M>
    Automated testing is also writing code. Sometimes it happens that this code
    is duplicated. Then what?
  </M>
  <M>
    You can duplicate the code or prepare something that will save you time and
    nerves when trying to manage such code - <B>don't repeat yourself rule</B>.{" "}
  </M>
  <M>
    So the role of fixture is to remove duplicate code and encapsulate it inside
    something we can use elsewhere (tests).
  </M>
  <M>
    This is precisely the first and, in my opinion, the most important role of{" "}
    <B>fixture</B>. What are the other roles then?
  </M>
  <List items="Creating and initializing objects or variables,Setting up test data,Preparing the test environment,Cleaning up after the test" />
  <M>
    We already know what and how so now it's time to play with the real code.
  </M>
</Section>

<Section>
  <XL>Removing the duplicated test code</XL>
  <M>
    Let's assume that we have the <B>EmojiSelect</B> component, in which we want
    to test several behaviors.{" "}
  </M>
  <M>
    The component is nothing more than a modal and a list of emoticons to use,
    from which we can choose any of them.
  </M>
  <Img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polubis/Snippets/main/emoji-picker.png" />
  <M>The tests for this component are as follows:</M>
  <Snippet>{`
 
describe('Emoji picker can be used when', () => {
  const TITLE: EmojiPickerProps['title'] = 'Pick your emoji';
  const DATA: EmojiPickerData = [{ emoji: 'üíÄ', name: 'skull' }];
 
  it('renders default emojis', () => {
    // ‚ö†Ô∏è Duplicated in each test.
    render(<EmojiPicker title={TITLE} onSelect={() => {}} />);
 
    screen.getByText(TITLE);
    screen.getByText(EMOJI_DATA[0].emoji);
  });
 
  it('allows to use own emoji data', () => {
    // ‚ö†Ô∏è Duplicated in each test.
    render(<EmojiPicker title={TITLE} data={DATA} onSelect={() => {}} />);
 
    screen.getByText(DATA[0].emoji);
  });
 
  it('renders emoji list items with data attribute', () => {
    // ‚ö†Ô∏è Duplicated in each test.
    render(<EmojiPicker data={DATA} title={TITLE} onSelect={() => {}} />);
 
    const element = screen.getByText(DATA[0].emoji);
 
    expect(element.dataset.emoji).toBe(DATA[0].emoji);
  });
  // ...other tests
});
`}</Snippet>
  <M>
    We have duplicated our <B>stub</B> object, which hides under the passed{" "}
    <B>props</B> to the components. So let's create our first fixture.
  </M>
  <Snippet>{`
    // It's added to reduce duplication of code in each test.
  const emojiPickerFixture = (props: Partial<EmojiPickerProps> = {}) => {
      // We pass on the default props and give the ability to overwrite them from other tests.
    const result = render(<EmojiPicker title={TITLE} onSelect={() => {}} {...props} />);
 
    // We return the result, because we may want to compare something in the tests.
    return result;
  }`}</Snippet>
  <M>Now it is time for a change in the tests.</M>
  <Snippet>{`
         it('renders default emojis', () => {
  // Much cleaner here...
  emojiPickerFixture();
  
  screen.getByText(TITLE);
  screen.getByText(EMOJI_DATA[0].emoji);
});
   `}</Snippet>
  <M>Well, what about other tests?</M>
  <Snippet>{`
 
describe('Emoji picker can be used when', () => {
  const TITLE: EmojiPickerProps['title'] = 'Pick your emoji';
  const DATA: EmojiPickerData = [{ emoji: 'üíÄ', name: 'skull' }];
 
  it('renders default emojis', () => {
    // ‚úÖ Now it's clean!
    emojiPickerFixture();
 
    screen.getByText(TITLE);
    screen.getByText(EMOJI_DATA[0].emoji);
  });
 
  it('allows to use own emoji data', () => {
    // ‚úÖ Now it's clean!
    emojiPickerFixture({ data: DATA });
    
    screen.getByText(DATA[0].emoji);
  });
 
  it('renders emoji list items with data attribute', () => {
    // ‚úÖ Now it's clean!
    emojiPickerFixture({ data: DATA });
 
    const element = screen.getByText(DATA[0].emoji);
 
    expect(element.dataset.emoji).toBe(DATA[0].emoji);
  });
  // ...other tests
});
`}</Snippet>
  <M>
    We removed duplicated code and changed the implementation of several tests.
    Now it's time for conclusions.{" "}
  </M>
</Section>

<Section>
  <XL>Conclusions and thoughts</XL>
  <M>So what can we see after our changes at first glance?</M>
  <List items="Tests are easier to implement - we focus on checking the result,Test code is not duplicated and is more readable,Later changes will be simpler - implementation of EmojiPicker initialization is in one place" />
  <M>
    Now a very important question arises. Should I do things this way
    everywhere? <B>Of course not!</B>
  </M>
  <M>
    Use this approach if you see a real profit. Does the test code duplicate? If
    so do <B>fixture</B>, if not skip it.{" "}
  </M>
  <M>
    In addition, let's pay attention to the fact that fixture is our{" "}
    <B>extra</B> code, and in any code mistakes can happen, so there can be a
    situation where the tests will work incorrectly not because of a bug in the
    application, but because of an incorrectly written fixture.

<Summary>
  <M>
    We have learned another piece of the puzzle called testing. Fixtures can be
    really useful and make your life easier.
  </M>
  <M>
    However, remember to use them with caution and for their intended purpose.
