<Prelude>
  <M>
    In this course we want to focus on important testing techniques and
    practices. I'll avoid talking about <B>project</B> creation or{" "}
    <B>test configuration</B>. If you don't have project to play with you can
    use the following{" "}
    <A outisde href="https://github.com/polubis/Dream-stack-for-React-dev/">
      repository template
    </A>{" "}
    where you have:{" "}
  </M>
  <List items="Applications to play with,Good standards and practices,Testing environment,Guides,Community support, It's constantly improved, Commits are linear and well organized" />
  <M>
    I'll use that template in whole course. In addition you can read this{" "}
    <A
      href="https://greenonsoftware.com/articles/thoughts/dream-stack-for-react-dev/"
      outside
    >
      article
    </A>{" "}
    where we explain <B>mentioned repo</B>. If you have your own app and tests
    configured - it's even better. You can try practices in your project and
    master them perfectly ðŸ“œ.

    Go to{" "}

      outside
    >
      repository
    </A>{" "}
    and click use template. After creating repo just clone it. Then type{" "}
    <B>npm install --legacy-peer-deps</B> and use commands which you want. You
    can find them in <B>README.md</B> file. They're are also explained below.
