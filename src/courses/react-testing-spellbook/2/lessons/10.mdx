    In previous lesson -{" "}
    <A href="/courses/react-testing-spellbook/mastering-unit-testing/mocking-environment-variables/">
      ‚≠ê Mocking environment variables
    </A>
    , we created a nice working <B>fixture</B> that reduces lines of code when
    we write tests.{" "}
  </M>
  <M>
    However, the result is not "ideal". Still, we may reduce and remove some
    responsibilities from developers. Check the following code to understand
    what I mean:{" "}

  <M>
    So, imagine a situation when you forget to add <B>afterEach</B> and{" "}
    <B>fixture.restore()</B> statement in one of your tests... It may happen
    because the <B>fixture.restore()</B> call cleans up all mocks in the
    environment object. Yea, it will be pretty hard to spot what is causing{" "}
    <B>false positives</B> or <B>false negatives</B> in our tests.{" "}
  </M>
  <M>
    {" "}
    Good news! <B>Dependency injection pattern</B> will fix all our problems üí®.
  </M>
</Prelude>

<Section>
  <XL>The dependency injection pattern</XL>
  <M>
    Let's explain it with another example not connected with our problem to
    understand the basic idea. Imagine that you've installed a library called{" "}
    <B>"users-list"</B> which is a <B>React</B> component with sorting
    capabilities (yea, really complicated :P).
  </M>
  <M>
    The implementation of component looks like this (remember it's a library
    code - in your app you just installed it):
  </M>
  <Code
    mode="dynamic"
    description="Some UsersList component loaded from npm lib"
    lang="tsx"
    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polubis/Snippets-for-articles-and-lessons/main/Using-dependency-injection-pattern-to-improve-fixtures/02-users-list.tsx"
    linesCount={24}
  />
  <M>
    {" "}
    Now, imagine that the implementation of this component sorting mechanism is broken
    - looks like the <B>sort</B> function from <B>Lodash</B> has a bug!
  </M>
  <Code
    mode="dynamic"
    lang="tsx"
    description="Uhhh, we have problem"
    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polubis/Snippets-for-articles-and-lessons/main/Using-dependency-injection-pattern-to-improve-fixtures/03-bug-in-lodash.tsx"
    linesCount={2}
  />
  <M>
    So, what's now? What kind of options do you have? You can try to find
    another lib, copy the lib source code to your code, wait for a fix, or
    implement it completely on your own... All of these options are
    time-consuming and it's just a <B>sort</B> function bug...
  </M>
  <M>
    If the author of the library would add one small change, we would not have
    to do anything... Check the code below to understand how we may improve it:{" "}
  </M>
  <Code
    added={[[7, 9]]}
    changed={[
      [11, 11],
      [16, 16],
    ]}

    lang="tsx"
    description="One parameter changed everything!"

  />
  <M>
    Instead of relying on and being coupled with <B>Lodash</B> without the
    option to override <B>sort mechanism</B>, we've added <B>UsersListProps</B>{" "}
    interface, to be able to change sorting mechanism. That's how{" "}
    <B>dependency injection pattern</B> works in its simplest form.{" "}
  </M>
  <M>
    You need to pass a function that implements the required contract - in our
    case specified via <B>TypeScript interface</B>. Now, we still are coupled
    with <B>Lodash</B>, but we may replace it from consumer code, not inside{" "}
    <B>UsersList</B> library implementation (in addition we improved our code
    from the SOLID perspective - <B>the Open/Close principle</B>.{" "}
  </M>
  <M>
    The last change must be implemented in the consumer component and our little
    bug will be fixed without any additional effort.{" "}
  </M>
  <Code
    mode="dynamic"
    lang="tsx"
    description="The sort mechanism is now injected"

  <Hint hasBg>
    <B>Dependency injection pattern</B> may be implemented in many different
    ways. We may use injection tokens and more advanced mechanisms. The
    presented approach is the simplest implementation of it!

  <XL>Fixing our fixture with dependency injection</XL>
  <M>
    We'll use the same technique as above. We'll pass <B>afterEach</B> function
    from <B>Jest</B> to our fixture. When the fixture is called the first time,
    it will trigger <B>afterEach</B>, so in test files all of these statements
    will be removed.

      [1, 1],

    First, we added an additional type to define the signature of{" "}
    <B>afterEach</B> function. We used <B>higher order function</B> pattern and{" "}
    <B>closure</B> mechanism to be able to call our fixture function twice.{" "}
  </M>
  <M>
    Second, with injected <B>afterEach</B> and passed the <B>key</B> that is
    required. Thanks to the <B>closure</B>, <B>afterEach</B> callback will be
    remembered and we'll be able to do stuff like this:{" "}

<Section>
  <XL>Small note</XL>
  <M>
    If you would like to add additional logic to <B>afterEach</B> and you're
    using this <B>fixture</B> - don't worry about anything, the <B>Jest</B> will
    run as many callbacks as you define :).
  </M>
  <Code
    mode="dynamic"
    lang="tsx"
    description="The afterEach statements are collected and called together by Jest"

    linesCount={10}
  />
  <M>
    So, you will have always called all defined <B>afterEach</B> functions, the
    one that we're passing and the others defined in tests. Thanks to that
    you're not limited to only one <B>afterEach</B> call.

<Summary label="Conclusions and thoughts">
  <M>
    As you saw we've added a nice improvement for developers that reduces the
    code that they need to write and the responsibility to "remember". In this{" "}
    <B>particular fixture</B>, it was just <B>3 lines</B> of code and{" "}
    <B>one responsibility</B>, but in more advanced ones it may be much more!
