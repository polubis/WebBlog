description: We will check what stubs are used for and what they really are.

<Prelude>
  <M>
    A <B>stub</B> is a simple, static object that is used to provide predictable
    responses to method calls. It is typically used to replace a{" "}
    <B>dependency</B> that is not directly related to the functionality being
    tested, but is required for the test to run.
  </M>
  <M>Wait, what? Yea, we need an example to understand this.</M>
</Prelude>

<Section>
  <XL>Examples of stubs</XL>
  <M>
    Imagine the situation when you have already <B>Select</B> component
    implemented. It takes several properties and some of them are required. You
    want to test <B>placeholder</B> displaying feature and be able to detect
    bugs without any in-depth checks.
  </M>
  <Snippet description="This is stub!">
    {` 
   it('allows to pass custom placeholder', () => {
  const propsStub: SelectProps = {
    options: [], 
    onChange: () => {}
  };
  
  // You'll test only placeholder but you need 
  // to pass options and onChange to make TypeScript calm.
  render(
    <Select {...propsStub} placeholder="placeholder" />
  );
  
  screen.getByText(/placeholder/);
});
   
`}
  </Snippet>
  <M>Congrats! You've created your first stub, but why you needed that?</M>
  <M>
    The <B>TypeScript</B> will scream that there are missing properties:{" "}
    <B>options array</B> and <B>onChange function</B>. You can cast it to{" "}
    <B>as any</B>, but it's wrong solution. Why you need TypeScript if you want
    to disable type-checking?
  </M>
  <M>
    Next problem is on <B>JavaScript</B> side. What will happen when select
    component will try to access initially of the required properites but they
    will be <B>undefined</B>? That's right... Big bum ðŸ”¥.
  </M>
  <M>That's exactly why you need stubs!</M>

<Summary>
  <M>
    Now you know what stubs are for. It's not a concept only related with React
    components or React testing. This approach is universal and completely
    independent from the technology you are working in - just like <B>SOLID</B>{" "}
    principles.
  </M>
  <M>
    You can stub <B>classes</B>, <B>objects</B> and others just to be able to
    test one dedicated part of something bigger.
