<Prelude label="What is End-to-End Testing?">
  <M>
    End-to-End testing is a software testing <B>methodology</B> that assesses
    the functionality of an application as <B>a whole</B>, including its
    interactions with external dependencies and systems. Unlike unit or
    integration testing, which focus on <B>individual components</B> or the{" "}
    <B>connections between them</B>, E2E testing examines the{" "}
    <B>entire software stack</B>. This involves testing user interfaces, APIs,
    databases, and various system components to ensure they work seamlessly{" "}
    <B>together</B>.

<Section>
  <XL>Key objectives of E2E testing</XL>
  <M>
    <B>Verification of business scenarios</B>
  </M>
  <M>
    E2E testing validates whether the application meets specified business
    requirements and behaves as expected in real-world scenarios. This includes
    testing user workflows, data processing, and interactions with external
    services.
  </M>
  <M>
    <B>Detection of integration issues</B>
  </M>
  <M>
    Identifying and addressing integration issues is a primary goal of E2E
    testing. This ensures that different modules and components collaborate
    effectively, preventing problems that might arise when they are combined.
  </M>
  <M>
    <B>User experience testing</B>
  </M>
  <M>
    E2E testing assesses the user interface and overall user experience to
    ensure that the application is intuitive, responsive, and user-friendly.
    This involves testing navigation, forms, and other interactive elements.
  </M>
  <M>
    <B>Data integrity and security</B>
  </M>
  <M>
    The testing process includes verifying data integrity and ensuring that
    sensitive information is handled securely. E2E testing helps identify
    potential vulnerabilities in the system that could compromise data security.
  </M>
  <M>
    <B>Technological agnosticism</B>
  </M>
  <M>
    End-to-End (E2E) tests should meticulously assess the application from the
    user's standpoint, treating it as a black box. Regardless of the underlying
    technology, whether it be in <B>React</B> or undergoing a transformation
    into <B>Angular</B>, these tests must retain their effectiveness.
  </M>
</Section>

<Section>
  <XL>Tools and frameworks for E2E testing</XL>
  <M>
    Several tools and frameworks facilitate the implementation of E2E testing.
    Popular ones include <B>Selenium</B>, <B>Cypress</B>, <B>Playwright</B>,{" "}
    <B>Puppeteer</B>, and <B>TestCafe</B>. These tools provide the necessary
    infrastructure to automate tests, simulate user interactions, and generate
    meaningful reports.

  <Hint hasBg>
    In this course, we will explore a variety of tools mentioned earlier, aiming
    to identify the most suitable ones for your projects. Our journey kicks off
    in the next lesson with a focus on <B>Cypress</B>.

<Section>
  <XL>Challenges in E2E testing</XL>
  <M>
    While E2E testing is essential for delivering robust software, it comes with
    its own set of challenges.
  </M>
  <M>
    <B>Complex test setup</B>
  </M>
  <M>
    Setting up comprehensive end-to-end tests can be complex, requiring careful
    consideration of various configurations and dependencies.
  </M>
  <M>
    <B>Execution time</B>
  </M>
  <M>
    E2E tests may take longer to execute compared to unit tests/integration
    tests, potentially slowing down the development and testing process.
  </M>
  <M>
    <B>Maintenance overhead</B>
  </M>
  <M>
    As applications evolve, E2E tests may require frequent updates to align with
    changes in the codebase, leading to maintenance overhead.
  </M>
  <M>
    <B>The money</B>
  </M>
  <M>
    Implementing poorly designed (E2E) tests can have financial repercussions.
    Consider a scenario where multiple features interact with a live{" "}
    <B>backend</B>, leading to frequent calls to endpoints. Crafting these tests
    in a way that minimizes costs while maximizing benefits poses a significant
    challenge. It requires a strategic approach to ensure that the testing
    process remains cost-effective while delivering valuable insights.
  </M>
  <M>
    <B>The flakiness</B>
  </M>
  <M>
    The intricacies of end-to-end (E2E) tests introduce a notable risk of
    fragility, where tests become highly susceptible to changes. Even a minor
    alteration to a test selector could potentially trigger a false negative
    result.
  </M>
</Section>

<Summary label="Conclusion and summary">
  <M>
    End-to-End testing is a critical component of the software development
    lifecycle, ensuring that applications perform optimally in real-world
    scenarios. By addressing integration issues, validating business scenarios,
    and assessing user experience, E2E testing contributes significantly to the
    delivery of high-quality software. While challenges exist, the benefits of
    thorough E2E testing in terms of system reliability, user satisfaction, and
    overall software quality make it an indispensable practice in modern
    software development.
