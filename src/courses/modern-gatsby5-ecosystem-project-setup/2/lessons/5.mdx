    Imagine a big project that you joined yesterday. Almost 1000 commits. So,
    you would like to check the progress of the project from a time perspective
    and verify how dedicated features have been developed. Traversing all of
    these commits may be really time-consuming and if their messages are not
    clear enough - you will have tons of problems understanding the context of
    the provided change...
  </M>
  <M>
    In another way, imagine a situation in which you made a problematic, buggy
    code and it has been pushed to the <B>main</B> branch. If your commit
    messages will look like in the below image, reverting these changes will be
    really hard.{" "}

    description="Ugly and inconsistent commit messages"
  />
  <M>
    That's why adding conventions for commits in your <B>Git</B> repository will
    make all of these activities much easier. You'll be able to understand the
    context, scope, and the reason why dedicated change has been added just by
    checking the commit name/message/body.{" "}

    The most popular conventions are from{" "}

  <XL>Commitlint: key to meaningful Git commits</XL>

    Verifying every commit manually will time consuming. So, I have good news
    for you. There is a plugin called <B>Commitlint</B> which does it for us. If
    the commit does not meet the conventions, during the commit stage in our
    IDE, we will get an error.

    lesson. If you don't know how to achieve it, just read it. So, we'll skip
    this part.
  </M>
  <M>
    First, we need to install packages as development dependency with following
    command:{" "}
    <B>npm i --save-dev @commitlint/cli commitlint/config-conventional</B>.
  </M>
  <Code
    mode="dynamic"
    lang="json"

    linesCount={4}
  />
  <M>
    Now, it's time for the configuration file in which we'll specify some rules
    for <B>Commitlint</B>. Let's create the <B>commitlint.config.js</B> file in
    the <B>root</B> directory with following content.
  </M>
  <Code
    mode="dynamic"
    lang="js"
    description="The commitlint.config.js file"
    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polubis/Snippets-for-articles-and-lessons/main/modern-gatsby5-ecosystem-project-setup/Organized%20Git%20commits%20with%20Commitlint/2.js"

  <M>
    The last part is adding <B>commit-msg</B> file under <B>.husky</B>{" "}
    directory.

  <Code
    mode="dynamic"

    linesCount={4}
  />
  <M>
    The first line indicates the interpreter to use. The second one runs another
    script - <B>husky.sh</B>. The last line triggers <B>Commitlint</B> with{" "}
    <B>edit mode</B>.{" "}
