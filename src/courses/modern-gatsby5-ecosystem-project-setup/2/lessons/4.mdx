    , we added <B>Tailwind</B>. Now, it's time to add <B>dark theme</B> support.
  </M>
  <M>
    Our mechanism will be based on external <B>Gatsby</B> plugin -{" "}
    <B>gatsby-plugin-dark-mode</B>. Thanks to this we'll avoid not needed
    complexity in our code. It will require some setup, but the benefits from
    this will be huge. In addition, our theme will be "remembered" by the
    browser, so if the user refresh the page, the previously chosen theme will
    be applied.

<Section>
  <XL>Let's add gatsby-plugin-dark-mode</XL>
  <M>
    At the beginning, we need to install as normal dependency mentioned plugin.
    To achieve it, type in your terminal:{" "}
    <B>npm i --save gatsby-plugin-dark-mode</B>. This plugin will be used on
    build - when <B>Gatsby</B> will generate pages and on the <B>client</B>, to
    change the theme.
  </M>

    linesCount={4}
  />
  <M>
    Now, we need to add our plugin to <B>gatsby-config.ts</B> file.{" "}
  </M>
  <Code

<Section>
  <XL>Using ThemeToggler to switch theme</XL>
  <M>
    Now, we need to define some styles that will work only when <B>dark mode</B>{" "}
    is selected. Let's do it inside <B>global.css</B> file.
  </M>
  <Code
    mode="dynamic"
    lang="css"
    description="The global.css file"
    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polubis/Snippets-for-articles-and-lessons/main/modern-gatsby5-ecosystem-project-setup/TailwindCSS%20dark%20mode%20configuration%20in%20Gatsby/3.css"
    linesCount={26}
  />
  <M>
    The <B>ThemeToggler</B> is a component, that implements{" "}
    <B>function as a child</B> pattern to inject internal state to child
    components. Inside the provided data, there is a property that determines
    the chosen theme and function to change the theme. You may use it in the
    following example:{" "}
  </M>
  <Code
    mode="dynamic"
    lang="tsx"
    description="The index.tsx file - home page"
    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polubis/Snippets-for-articles-and-lessons/main/modern-gatsby5-ecosystem-project-setup/TailwindCSS%20dark%20mode%20configuration%20in%20Gatsby/4.tsx"
    linesCount={23}
  />
  <M>
    Take a look at different ways to style our <B>HTML</B> via classes. We may
    use the <B>global</B> way, that you saw in <B>global.css</B> file, or we may
    do it "inline" with <B>dark prefix</B>.{" "}
  </M>
  <M>
    There is still one missing part to make it work. We need to tell the{" "}
    <B>Tailwind</B> and the <B>plugin</B>, how dark mode class should be
    attached. We need to provide the following changes in{" "}
    <B>tailwind.config.js</B> file:{" "}

  <Code
    mode="dynamic"

  <XL>Adding missing TypeScript definitions</XL>
  <M>
    If you open the IDE inside modified files, you'll see a lot of{" "}
    <B>TypeScript</B> errors. It's because the plugin that we've installed,
    doesn't contain type definitions. We are lucky that the exposed API of the
    plugin is really small, so we may add our own type definitions inside our
    project.

    description="TypeScript warns us about missing defs"
  />
  <M>
    To fix it we need to define types, update <B>tsconfig.json</B> file to tell{" "}
    <B>TypeScript</B> - "Hey! There are additional types for this library". So,
    let's start with <B>type definitions</B>. Let's add them inside the
    following file: <B>src/declarations/gatsby-plugin-dark-mode.d.ts</B>. We
    added an additional "declarations" folder - maybe in the future there will
    be another package to cover with types.{" "}

    description="The gatsby-plugin-dark-mode.d.ts file"

  <M>
    Definitions are ready, but still <B>TypeScript</B> doesn't have any idea
    what it is. We need to update <B>tsconfig.json</B> file in following
    way:{" "}

<Summary label="Conclusions and next steps">
  <M>
    Now our <B>dark mode</B> feature is enabled! Now, you need to add dedicated
    selectors in your <B>css</B> files or "inline" with <B>dark</B> prefix in
    class names.
  </M>
  <M>
    It's good to mention that the implemented solution remembers the chosen
    state. So, after the page refresh, there is still a theme available.{" "}
