    Now, it's time to add <B>Tailwind</B> to our project.
  </M>
  <M>
    We want to connect <B>Tailwind</B> framework to <B>Gatsby</B>. This duo is
    really powerful and makes our life/developer experience much easier. The
    setup is really easy. It's almost the same as described in the
    documentation, just some parts are different.

  <XL>Installation of required dependencies</XL>
  <M>
    We need to install the required dependencies to make it work. To be precise,
    only <B>development</B> dependencies. So, type the following command in your
    terminal:{" "}
  </M>
  <M>
    <B>npm i --save-dev tailwind postcss gatsby-plugin-postcss autoprefixer</B>
  </M>

      Autoprefixer is a PostCSS plugin that automatically adds vendor prefixes
      to your CSS code, ensuring compatibility with various web browsers and
      reducing the need for manual prefixing,
    </Li>
    <Li>
      PostCSS is a versatile tool for processing CSS, offering a wide range of
      plugins to transform and optimize your stylesheets,
    </Li>
    <Li>
      Gatsby-plugin-postcss integrates PostCSS into Gatsby projects, allowing
      you to leverage the capabilities of PostCSS to enhance your site's CSS and
      optimize performance,
    </Li>
    <Li>
      TailwindCSS is a utility-first CSS framework that simplifies and
      streamlines the process of creating responsive and well-structured user
      interfaces.

<Section>
  <XL>Adding default Tailwind styles</XL>
  <M>
    To make <B>Tailwind</B> work, we need to have its default styles attached to{" "}
    <B>main</B> style file. In our case let's create under <B>src</B> directory,
    the <B>global.css</B> file with following content:
  </M>
  <Code
    mode="dynamic"
    lang="tsx"
    description="The global.css file under src directory"
    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polubis/Snippets-for-articles-and-lessons/main/modern-gatsby5-ecosystem-project-setup/global-file.css"
    linesCount={3}
  />
  <M>
    With these 3 lines, we included basic styles like resets, paddings, and
    margins. Next, we added utility classes like "px-3", ...etc. If we would
    like to use components - the last line is responsible for adding styles for
    it.{" "}
  </M>
  <M>
    Now, we need to attach this file with styles to <B>gatsby-browser.ts</B>{" "}
    file, which we need to create at the root of our repository - not under{" "}
    <B>src</B>!
  </M>
  <Code
    mode="dynamic"
    lang="tsx"
    description="The gatsby-browser.ts file"
    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polubis/Snippets-for-articles-and-lessons/main/modern-gatsby5-ecosystem-project-setup/imp1.css"
    linesCount={1}
  />
</Section>

<Section>
  <XL>Adding configuration files</XL>
  <M>
    Unfortunately, if we try to use styles in any of our components or pages, it
    will not work. Still, we need to add some configuration stuff. The first
    config will be the one for <B>Tailwind</B>. Create a{" "}
    <B>tailwind.config.js</B> file under the root directory.
  </M>
  <Code
    mode="dynamic"
    lang="js"
    description="The tailwind.config.js file"
    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polubis/Snippets-for-articles-and-lessons/main/modern-gatsby5-ecosystem-project-setup/tw-1.js"
    linesCount={15}
  />
  <M>
    The really important part is the <B>content</B> property. If you add new
    directories and you want to use styles inside components defined there, you
    need to add a pattern to the <B>content</B> property. So, if you'll add new
    components under <B>src/components</B> directory, you need to change this in
    the following way:
  </M>
  <Code
    mode="dynamic"
    lang="js"
    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polubis/Snippets-for-articles-and-lessons/main/modern-gatsby5-ecosystem-project-setup/tw2.js"
    linesCount={1}
  />
  <M>
    Now, it's time for <B>postcss.config.js</B> file. We need to create it at
    the root directory.{" "}
  </M>
  <Code
    mode="dynamic"
    lang="js"
    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polubis/Snippets-for-articles-and-lessons/main/modern-gatsby5-ecosystem-project-setup/tw-3.js"
    linesCount={6}
    description="The postcss.config.js file"
  />
  <M>
    This file will have an empty configuration - we don't need for our case to
    add <B>Autoprefixer</B> or change the <B>Tailwind</B> behavior.{" "}
  </M>
  <M>
    Last, the most important part - we need to add installed{" "}
    <B>gatsby-plugin-postcss</B> to our <B>gatsby.config.ts</B> file. This
    plugin integrates <B>Tailwind</B> with <B>Gatsby</B> and allows us to add
    additional configuration.{" "}
  </M>
  <Code
    mode="dynamic"
    lang="tsx"
    description="The gatsby-config.ts file"
    added={[[2, 2]]}
    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polubis/Snippets-for-articles-and-lessons/main/modern-gatsby5-ecosystem-project-setup/tw-4.js"
    linesCount={2}
  />
</Section>

<Section>
  <XL>Testing the setup</XL>
  <M>
    Now, when you run the project on <B>development</B> environment via{" "}
    <B>npm run start</B>, you'll be able to use <B>Tailwind</B>!
  </M>
  <Code
    mode="dynamic"
    lang="tsx"
    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polubis/Snippets-for-articles-and-lessons/main/modern-gatsby5-ecosystem-project-setup/tw-5.tsx"
    linesCount={7}
  />
  <M>
    To be sure that everything works correctly also on production build, run{" "}
    <B>npm run build</B> and then, <B>npm run serve</B> - the application will
    be opened on another port, and you'll have information about that.{" "}

<Summary label="Conclusions and next steps">
  <M>
    <B>Tailwind</B> works. The setup was kinda quick. Thanks to <B>plugins</B>{" "}
    available in <B>Gatsby</B> ecosystem, it's really easy to configure all what
    we need.

  <M>
    In the next article, we'll add support for <B>dark mode</B> to our project!
