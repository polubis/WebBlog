<Prelude label="Before we start">
  <M>
    The goal of this course is to create a repository, not deep dive into all
    concepts connected with course stack. So, we'll focus only on topics
    connected with the project setup.{" "}
  </M>
  <M>
    Make sure that you have installed <B>Node 18.18.0</B> version. If you have
    different one, feel free to use{" "}

    </A>{" "}
    tool, to be able to switch versions quickly.{" "}
  </M>
  <M>
    In addition, we'll use <B>npm</B> in version <B>8.11.0</B>. You may have
    weird errors if your versions will be different, so please keep it in mind.

  <XL>About links and resources</XL>
  <M>
    Under this lesson, we'll add all resources to the links that will be used in
    this course. It's just for the sake of better navigation. So, if you already
    checked all lessons, below you'll have all important links (source code,
    final examples, ...etc.).

  <XL>The goals</XL>
  <M>
    A lot of developers work with <B>Gatsby</B>. I've built many sites with this
    framework and I must say I really like it. In this course, we'll create a
    bulletproof <B>Gatsby5</B> template with a modern ecosystem, so you'll be
    able to start your next projects really fast without additional effort.
  </M>
  <M>
    So, the goal of this small course is to create a developer-friendly,
    high-performant, scalable, plug-and-play repository template on{" "}
    <B>Github</B>. We'll create a project, then we'll configure all the stuff
    around. In this course, we will:{" "}
  </M>
  <L>
    <Li>create a Gatsby5 project with TypeScript,</Li>
    <Li>setup Eslint, Prettier, Husky, and Commitlint for the project,</Li>
    <Li>add Tailwind and dark mode support,</Li>
    <Li>
      add md and mdx syntax support for creating pages dynamically via these
      files,
    </Li>
    <Li>connect Zustand library to manage the state,</Li>
    <Li>add Storybook setup and Chromatic configuration for the project,</Li>
    <Li>prepare the testing environment with Jest and Cypress,</Li>
    <Li>add type-checking, test execution, and automatic deployment.</Li>
  </L>
