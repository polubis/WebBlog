    Let's begin by unraveling the fundamental <B>SEO</B> terms. Later, we'll
    explore real-world examples for each term, sometimes using simpler and more
    straightforward cases.

      "SEO (Search Engine Optimization)" - the procedure of enhancing a

  <XL>Understanding "Search Engine Optimization"</XL>
  <M>
    Picture the entire internet as a gigantic store filled with valuable books
    from around the world. It's so massive that it would occupy the entire space
    of the <B>USA</B>! Each book in this virtual store has its own genre,
    category, and metadata, such as authors, number of pages, and more.
  </M>
  <M>
    Now, think of the internet as a similar vast store, but instead of a person
    sluggishly searching for a book, you have a swift and intelligent algorithm
    powered by AI. Just like in a real store, you try to find a book by its
    title (if you know it) or by its metadata.
  </M>
  <M>
    Now, imagine authors complaining that their book isn't getting enough
    attention! There could be various reasons:
  </M>
  <L ordered>
    <Li>The book might not be great</Li>
    <Li>The author could be unknown</Li>
    <Li>The book may have a poorly designed table of contents and cover</Li>
    <Li>The story might be lacking</Li>
    <Li>The metadata and book description might not be appealing</Li>
  </L>
  <M>
    There could be several reasons why. As you can see, being a content creator
    is not as simple as it seems. So, the frustrated author turns to an agency
    that specializes in promoting all kinds of books, aiming to make them
    popular and, of course, generate revenue. The agency makes significant
    changes: altering the book title, adding a more famous co-author, rewriting
    the book description, removing poorly designed content, and selling it as an
    entirely new book! After these changes, the number of clients skyrockets
    from 100 per month to 100,000.
  </M>
  <M>
    The <B>SEO</B> process in this analogy is like the <B>agency</B>. In SEO, we
    take a website and its pages, enhancing content, metadata, performance,
    thumbnail, and <B>HTML semantics</B> to improve the site's visibility in
    various search engines.
  </M>

<Section>
  <XL>"Keywords" for SEO success</XL>
  <M>
    <B>Keywords</B> play a crucial role in enhancing visibility across various
    search engines. Consider them as tags or metadata for books in our previous{" "}
    <B>bookstore</B> analogy. Creating effective keywords is vital, and as
    outlined by specialists at <B>Ahrefs</B>, a well-chosen keyword should meet
    specific criteria.
  </M>
  <M>
    This is the moment when <B>keyword research</B> becomes crucial. It involves
    the process of discovering and collecting information about the most popular
    phrases entered into search engines, aiming to boost revenue and drive
    traffic to your website.
  </M>
</Section>

<Section>
  <XL>The most important "keywords metrics"</XL>
  <M>
    There are numerous considerations, but one of the most critical is{" "}
    <B>Traffic Potential</B>. This metric gauges the amount of traffic (unique
    visits) your page could receive if it achieves a top ranking on a{" "}
    <B>Google Search</B>.
  </M>
  <M>
    Why is another metric, <B>Search Demand</B>, considered less crucial? The
    answer is straightforward. Think of it this way: Who cares about customers
    merely peering into your shop without entering? While <B>Search Demand</B>{" "}
    is essential for gauging the overall interest in a specific phrase, it
    shouldn't be the primary or most significant factor when selecting dedicated
    keywords or a topic to rank.
  </M>
  <Hint hasBg>
    It's crucial to note that various platforms such as <A>Ahrefs</A> or{" "}
    <A>Google Keyword Planner</A> might use slightly different terms to describe
    identical metrics. For instance, <B>Traffic Potential</B> might be referred
    to as <B>Organic Traffic</B>, among other names. Carefully read the
    descriptions to avoid confusion.
