  <XL>Why?</XL>
  <M>
    Sometimes there is a need to read the size of a <B>window</B> or a specific{" "}
    <B>HTML element</B>. The most common reason for that is to display a
    particular element in an application based on the size of a device.
  </M>
  <M>
    This is a perfect example of logic that will repeat itself in many
    applications, so it is worth to encapsulate it in a hook.
