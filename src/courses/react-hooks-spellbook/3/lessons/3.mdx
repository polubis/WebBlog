  <XL>Why?</XL>
  <M>
    Sometimes there is a need to read the size of a <B>window</B> or a specific{" "}
    <B>HTML element</B>. The most common reason is to show or hide a particular
    element in the application based on the size of the device or to use these
    sizes for calculations.
  </M>
  <M>
    This is a perfect example of logic that will repeat itself in many
    applications, so it is worth encapsulating it in a hook.
