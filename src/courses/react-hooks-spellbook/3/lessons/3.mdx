<Prelude label="Understanding the use cases for the useClickOutside hook">
  <M>Imagine you've built the <B>Modal</B> or <B>Sidebar</B> component that contains a backdrop behind or you have a <B>Popover</B> component that displays a small menu when clicking the dedicated button.</M>
  <M>These components must be closed after clicking the backdrop area (for <B>Modal</B> and <B>Sidebar</B>) or in the case when you have <B>Popover</B> component, you need to detect the moment of click the space out of the <B>Popover</B> trigger element.</M>

<M>So as you saw, we just closed these components after clicking <B>outside</B> their area. Let's create the <B>useClickOutside</B> hook to be able to reuse such logic between different components.</M>

</Prelude>

<Section>
  <XL>How we'll use useClickOutside hook?</XL>
  <M>
    Look at the following code snippet in which we used our hook, and assigned <B>ref</B> to <B>div</B> element, and we passed a callback to the hook configuration that will be triggered when user clicks outside. 
  </M>
  <Code mode="static" lang="ts">{`const MyAnyComponent = () => {
  const handleClick = () => {
    console.log('Clicked inside!')
  }
 
  const handleClickOutside = () => {
    console.log('Outside click!')
  }
  // Remember to pass always a type of used HTML element!
  const { ref } = useClickOutside<HTMLDivElement>({
    onOutside: handleClickOutside,
  });
 
  return (
    <div ref={ref}>
      <button onClick={handleClick}>Click me!</button>
    </div>
  )
}`}</Code>
<M>What is really cool? Look how <B>TypeScript</B> will protect us from using invalid elements. </M>

<Section>
  <XL>Let's create type definitions for the useClickOutside hook</XL>
  <M>
    We need to define a <B>types</B> for the configuration object and for the
    stuff that will be returned by our hook.
  </M>
  <Code mode="static" lang="ts">{`import type { MutableRefObject } from 'react';
 
// This object will be passed to the hook.
interface UseClickOutsideConfig {
  // Callback to trigger when outside click is detected.
  onOutside: () => void;
}
 
// This will be returned by the hook.
// We extended the HTMLElement to be sure that the passed 
// generic type will have a base of HTMLElement.
interface UseClickOutsideReturn<T extends HTMLElement> {
  // Ref is a "React" reference created by useRef hook.
  // It may be null because the ref value depends on
  // the parent component. If we forget to assign ref to
  // "HTML node", a ref will be null by default.
  ref: MutableRefObject<T | null>;
}
`}</Code>
  <M>The most important aspects: </M>
  <L>
    <Li>
      we imported a type provided by React, that describes the reference object.
      This ref object may be null. Its value depends on what the parent
      component does with the ref returned by our hook,
    </Li>
    <Li>
      the configuration object requires a callback that will be called when an
      outside click will be detected,
    </Li>
    <Li>
      the passed generic type "T" must have a base of HTMLElement, if the parent
      component will assign the ref value to something else - it's a big mistake
      and our hook will not work.
    </Li>
  </L>
</Section>

<Section>
  <XL>Implementing the useClickOutside hook</XL>
  <M>
    We'll import previously created types and then, we'll write an
    implementation that matches created contract.
  </M>
  <Code
    mode="static"
    lang="ts"
  >{`const useClickOutside = <T extends HTMLElement>({
  onOutside,
}: UseClickOutsideConfig) => {
  // Stores a reference to the HTML element that will be tracked.
  const ref = useRef<T>(null);
 
  useEffect(() => {
    const handleClickOutside = (e: MouseEvent) => {
      // If the clicked element doesn't contain the target one, 
      // it means it's an outside click!
      ref.current?.contains(e.target as Node) || onOutside();
    };
    // We're adding a mouse-down event.
    document.addEventListener('mousedown', handleClickOutside);
 
    return () => {
      // We're removing a mouse-down event.
      document.removeEventListener('mousedown', handleClickOutside);
    };
  }, []);
  
  return { ref };
};
`}</Code>
  <M>
    Why we've used <B>assertion</B> here? By saying assertion I mean the syntax{" "}
    <B>as Node</B>. It's because the <B>contains</B> method requires type{" "}
    <B>Node</B> but <B>e.target</B> has a type <B>EventTarget | null</B>. This
    causes <B>TypeScript</B> to yield the following prompt:{" "}
  </M>
  <M>
    <B>
      Argument of type 'EventTarget | null' is not assignable to parameter of
      type 'Node | null'.
    </B>
  </M>
  <M>
    Is it type-safe? Of course, it's not! We need to improve that with{" "}
    <B>type-guard</B> and when it will determine that the passed element is not
    a <B>typeof Node</B>, we'll throw an exception - our hook will not work as
    designed because something with unsupported shape has been passed to the
    event callback.{" "}
  </M>
  <Code mode="static" added={[[4, 5]]} changed={[[8, 10]]} lang="ts">{`
// The "node" have a specific property "nodeType".
// If it exists inside the passed target it 
// means that is the type of "node".
const assertIsNode = (target: EventTarget | Node | null): target is Node =>
  !!target && 'nodeType' in target;
  
// Now inside the click handler.
const handleClickOutside = ({ target }: MouseEvent) => {
  (assertIsNode(target) && ref.current?.contains(target)) || onOutside();
};
`}</Code>
  <M>
    The <B>in</B> operator returns <B>true</B> if a property exists in an
    object. The <B>!!</B> operator converts the variable to <B>bool</B>, we're
    doing that because our <B>target</B> parameter may be an object or null. The
    syntax <B>target is Node</B> is the key here. If the created function will
    return <B>true</B> it means the type of <B>target</B> will be remembered by{" "}
    <B>TypeScript</B> as a <B>Node</B> type.
  </M>
  <M>
    We just created our <B>custom type-guard</B>. Now complete implementation
    looks like this:{" "}
  </M>
  <Code
    rolled
    mode="static"
    lang="ts"

  onOutside,
}: UseClickOutsideConfig) => {
  const ref = useRef<T>(null);
 
  useEffect(() => {
    const handleClickOutside = ({ target }: MouseEvent) => {
      (assertIsNode(target) && ref.current?.contains(target)) || onOutside();
    };
 
    document.addEventListener('mousedown', handleClickOutside);
 
    return () => {
      document.removeEventListener('mousedown', handleClickOutside);
    };
  }, []);
 
  return { ref };

  <XL>Writting the tests for useClickOutside hook</XL>
  <M>The most important aspects to test are:</M>
  <L ordered>
    <Li>we need to check if the "mousedown" event is attached and removed,</Li>
    <Li>we need to verify if the outside click mechanism is working.</Li>
  </L>
  <M>
    We'll use <B>react-testing-library</B>, the <B>fixture</B> pattern, and{" "}
    <B>spies</B> to perform our tests.
  </M>
  <Hint hasBg>
    If you want to know what is the <B>fixture</B> pattern, please read

    Let's start from testing the <B>mousedown</B> event mechanism:{" "}
  </M>
  <Code mode="static" lang="ts">{`  it('removes event listeners', () => {
  const removeEventListenerSpy = jest.spyOn(document, 'removeEventListener');

  unmount();
 
  expect(removeEventListenerSpy).toHaveBeenCalledWith(
    'mousedown',
    expect.any(Function)
  );
});`}</Code>
  <M>
    Now we need to use <B>fixture</B> to act like the <B>truthy</B> component is
    using our hook, we don't have any other option - we want to test a real
    click outside situation.
