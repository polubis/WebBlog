<Prelude>
  <M>
    Let's say you have a great homepage with fancy looking animation - you're
    animating the{" "}
    <A href="https://greenonsoftware.com/" outside>
      black hole
    </A>{" "}
    inside <B>canvas</B>. It's good to animate it only when users actually see
    it. So you could detect whether the user is seeing the section with the
    animation and based on that, turn it on or off.
  </M>
  <Img

  />
  <M>
    The browser have a dedicated API for that - <B>IntersectionObserver</B>.
    When writing in <B>React</B>, it's a good idea to create a proper hook to
    handle such logic for your own convenience and the ability to use it in
    every component.

    you have the final result.

  <XL>Usage</XL>
  <M>
    This is how we will use our <B>useIntersectionObserver</B> hook.{" "}
  </M>
  <Snippet description="An example of use">{`
 // The visible flag will change if the div will have 40% visibility.
const { visible, ref } = useIntersectionObserver<HTMLDivElement>({ treshhold: 0.4 });
  
return (
  <>
   {/*We pass ref to element we want to observe.*/}
    <div ref={ref} style={{ minHeight: '100vh' }}>
      Your main homepage section.
    </div>
    <div style={{ minHeight: '100vh' }}>
      Other home page content.
    </div>
    <div>{visible ? 'Main homepage section is visible' : ''}</div>
  </>
)`}</Snippet>

  <M>
    First, let's create interfaces. They will define what our hook will accept
    and what will return.

  />
  <M>
    Now it's time to implement the <B>useIntersectionObserver</B> hook itself.
    We have interfaces so we know how it should more or less work.
  </M>

  />
  <M>
    Hook cannot be used on the server side - so we blocked this option at the
    very beginning.
  </M>
  <M>
    In addition, if the native <B>IntersectionObserver</B> API is not supported
    then our code will not work either. So we logged an error for developers.
  </M>
  <M>
    Next, we created an <B>IntersectionObserver</B> object, we passed a callback
    and a configuration object.

<Summary>
  <M>
    Now you know how to track any element on the interface and respect the
    resources of the browser.
