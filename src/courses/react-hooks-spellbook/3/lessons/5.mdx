    The <B>useScroll</B> hook can be used for reading scroll <B>metadata</B>{" "}
    connected with the target (<B>HTML element</B> or <B>window</B> object). It
    may be the direction in which the user is moving too or the exact scroll
    offset from the <B>top/left</B>.

<Section>
  <XL>The example of useScroll usage</XL>
  <M>The hook can be consumed in two ways:</M>
  <L ordered>
    <Li>
      It can detect the window scroll metadata or any HTML element (for HTML
      elements you need to consume ref returned from hook and pass the type of
      an element).
    </Li>
    <Li>
      It can detect scroll metadata based on provided axis - it can be "x" or
      "y".
    </Li>
  </L>
  <Code
    lang="tsx"
    mode="static"
  >{`// When want to read the HTML element metadata.
const IReadTheDivMetadata = () => {
  // Delay determines the debounce time in ms.
  // Axis can be "x" or "y".
  const [metadata, ref] = useScroll<HTMLDivElement>({ delay: 1000, axis: "x" });
 
  return (
    <div ref={ref}>
      {/* Prints the div scroll x metadata. */}
      {console.log(metadata)}
    </div>
  );
};
 
// When we want to read window metadata.
const IReadTheWindowMetadata = () => {
  const [metadata] = useScroll();
 
  return (
    <div>
      {/* Prints the window scroll y metadata. */}
      {console.log(metadata)}
    </div>
  );
};`}</Code>
  <M>
    In addition, you can pass the <B>delay</B> property in <B>ms</B>. Inside the
    debounce mechanism is used to avoid too many checks during user interaction
    - it's just for sake of performance.
  </M>
</Section>

<Section>
  <XL>Types definition for useScroll hook</XL>
  <M>
    Types are very important. For the sake of transparency and readability, we
    moved them to separate file - in our case <B>defs.ts</B>. Let's start from
    the basic ones:
  </M>
  <Code mode="static" lang="ts">{`
// The previous and current scroll offset after user interaction.
interface BaseScrollState {
  prev: number;
  curr: number;
}
// Possible scroll axis.
type ScrollAxis = 'x' | 'y';
// The config that is optional by default.
interface ScrollConfig {
  axis?: ScrollAxis;
  delay?: number;
}
`}</Code>
  <M>
    Now we need to define the shape of internal state. Let's think about the
    possible situations. During scrolling, user may have following scenarions:
  </M>
  <L>
    <Li>Nothing happens - let's call it "idle".</Li>
    <Li>User scrolled down or right - let's call it "progress".</Li>
    <Li>User scrolled up or left - let's call it "regress".</Li>
    <Li>
      User scrolled up/down but the scroll previous and current offset is the
      same - let's call it "unchanged".
    </Li>
  </L>
  <M>
    So, we have 4 possible states. Now it's time to define interfaces for them.
    Every state will have a separate interface with shared property - let's call
    it <B>is</B>. We'll use a <B>TypeScript union</B> mechanism and we'll use
    the <B>exhaustiveness checking</B> technique. It will protect us from
    reading not "ready" information in runtime.
  </M>
  <Code mode="static" lang="ts">{`
interface IdleScrollState {
  is: 'idle';
}
// Notice the "extends" keyword usage.
interface ProgressScrollState extends BaseScrollState {
  is: 'progress';
}
 
interface RegressScrollState extends BaseScrollState {
  is: 'regress';
}
 
interface UnchangedScrollState extends BaseScrollState {
  is: 'unchanged';
}
// Union, so now we'll need to check the "is" property
// before reading the state from hook. 
type ScrollState =
  | IdleScrollState
  | ProgressScrollState
  | RegressScrollState
  | UnchangedScrollState;
// Helper type. Just for avoiding doing that:
// ScrollState['is'].
type ScrollResult = ScrollState['is'];
`}</Code>
  <M>
    Now look at what will happen when you would like to read the state of a
    hook. TypeScript will block you from reading the <B>prev/curr</B> properties
    at the <B>idle</B> state but will let you read them in other states.
  </M>
  <Img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polubis/Dream-stack-for-React-dev/article/Reading-scroll-metadata-and-position-with-useScroll-hook/exh-check.gif" />
  <M>
    Now it's time for the last type. Let's define what the <B>useScroll</B> hook
    need to return. It will be a <B>read-only tuple</B>. The first element will
    be a <B>state</B> and the second will be the <B>React ref object</B>.
  </M>
  <Code lang="ts" mode="static">{`import type { MutableRefObject } from 'react';
// The generic type is optional and assigned to "HTMLElement" as default. 
// "MutableRefObject" will be a ref created by "useRef" hook.
type ScrollReturn<T extends HTMLElement = HTMLElement> = Readonly<
  [ScrollState, MutableRefObject<T | null>]
>;`}</Code>
  <M>
    Now all types needs to be exported and we can start the hook implementation.
    Before that, it's good to mention some stuff:{" "}
  </M>
  <L>
    <Li>
      We used "T" generic to be able to pass the type of HTML element - for
      example HTMLDivElement, HTMLInputElement and others - it provides
      additional type-safety.
    </Li>
    <Li>
      The MutableRefObject takes a "T" or "null". It's because if we want to
      check the metadata of "window" instead of "HTMLElement", the ref is not
      needed so it will be a "null".
    </Li>
    <Li>
      We've used a "tuple" to provide developers an easy option to assign
      their own names for returned values.
    </Li>
  </L>
  <M>Under this file, you have complete types definition.</M>

<Section>
  <XL>Let's implement the useScroll hook</XL>
  <M>We have an interfaces so it's time to play! Let's consider some cases:</M>
  <L ordered>
    <Li>
      The debounce mechanism must be applied. Listening to the scroll events
      and calling the callbacks too often, may hurt the performance.
    </Li>
    <Li>
      The hook may be used on the server side. So we need to guarantee that it
      will work there and not will not throw an exception during this phase.
    </Li>
    <Li>
      The properties responsible for reading scroll metadata for window and HTML
      element object differs. So we need to provide some unification for a
      better development experience.
    </Li>
    <Li>
      If the window object and HTML element both are undefined - it means the
      developer used the hook in an invalid way. So in this case we need to log
      a warning.
    </Li>
    <Li>
      The default parameters for the configuration object must be defined. The
      commonly used scroll is in the "y" axis and the "delay",
      can be 150ms by default.
    </Li>
  </L>
  <M>Firstly, let's import previously defined types.</M>
  <Code mode="static" lang="ts">{`import type {
  ScrollAxis,
  ScrollConfig,
  ScrollReturn,
  ScrollResult,
  ScrollState,
} from './defs';`}</Code>
  <M>
    Now it's time for helper functions to read the scroll metadata according to
    the used <B>window</B> or <B>HTML element</B> objects.
  </M>
  <Code mode="static" lang="ts">{`
// That's a type guard for type-safety.
const isHTMLElement = <T extends HTMLElement>(ref: T | Window): ref is T =>
  (ref as T).offsetTop !== undefined;
// Read scroll offset when the axis is "y". 
const getScrollYValue = <T extends HTMLElement>(ref: T | Window): number =>
  isHTMLElement(ref) ? ref.scrollTop : ref.scrollY;
// Read scroll offset when the axis is "x". 
const getScrollXValue = <T extends HTMLElement>(ref: T | Window): number =>
  isHTMLElement(ref) ? ref.scrollLeft : ref.scrollX;
// Calls appropriate function based on the given axis. 
const getScrollValue = <T extends HTMLElement>(
  axis: ScrollAxis,
  ref: T | Window
): number => (axis === 'x' ? getScrollXValue(ref) : getScrollYValue(ref));
// Determines the result value based on the prev/curr scroll offset. 
const getScrollResult = (prev: number, curr: number): ScrollResult => {
  if (prev === curr) return 'unchanged';
  return prev < curr ? 'progress' : 'regress';
};`}</Code>
  <M>
    And what about logging a warning for developers if the hook will be used in
    an invalid way?
  </M>
  <Code mode="static" lang="ts">{`const warn = (): void => {
  console.warn(\`
      Can't find the reference, and the window object. So this hook will not work.
   
      It may be caused because: 
        - you're rendering ref conditionally,
        - you forgot to use forwardRef() - when ref passed to component,
        - you're using this hook on a server.
    \`);
};`}</Code>
  <M>
    Why these functions should be inside the same file as the future implemented{" "}
    <B>useScroll</B> hook? It's because of the internal implementation details.
    We want to hide everything that is related to these details from the
    consumer module.
  </M>
  <M>Almost lastly, we need to create a hook itself.</M>
  <Code
    mode="static"
    lang="ts"
  >{`const useScroll = <T extends HTMLElement = HTMLElement>({
  axis = 'y',
  delay = 150,
}: ScrollConfig = {}): ScrollReturn<T> => {
  const ref = useRef<T>(null);
  // We used a function to set the initial 
  // state to avoid creating an object during every re-render.
  const [state, setState] = useState<ScrollState>(() => ({ is: 'idle' }));
 
  return [state, ref];
};
 
export { useScroll };`}</Code>
  <M>
    Now when our hook matches the given contract defined by interfaces, we can
    implement the logic itself. We should use <B>useLayoutEffect</B> hook. It's
    because we're reading real <B>DOM</B> information so we need to have a 100%
    guarantee that they are ready to be read.
  </M>
  <M>
    It's because <B>useEffect</B> is async and <B>useLayoutEffect</B> is sync.
    So, with <B>useEffect</B> our read data can be "old" and it may cause weird
    bugs...
  </M>
  <Code mode="static" lang="ts">{`
// It's near the import section.
import { debounceTime, fromEvent } from 'rxjs';
// It's a code inside a hook ⬆️.
useLayoutEffect(() => {
  // Reading the target. It may be HTML element or window.
  const target = ref.current ? ref.current : window;
 
  if (!target) {
    // If target is "undefined" - we're logging a warning
    // and doing nothing - "fail fast" approach.
    warn();
    return;
  }
  // We're reading the initial scroll position.
  let prev = getScrollValue(axis, target);
  // We're making an "observable" from the native "scroll" event. 
  // Thanks to that we're able to use "rxjs" operators.
  const obs$ = fromEvent(target, 'scroll')
    .pipe(debounceTime(delay))
    .subscribe(() => {
      // We're reading the initial scroll position.
      const curr = getScrollValue(axis, target);
 
      setState({
        prev,
        curr,
        // We are assigning the result based on "prev/curr" values.
        is: getScrollResult(prev, curr),
      });
 
      prev = curr;
    });
 
  return () => {
    // Clean up to avoid memory leaks.
    obs$.unsubscribe();
  };
  // When configuration properties will 
  // change, we want to re-create the subscription.
}, [delay, axis]);`}</Code>
  <M>
    We've used here <B>rxjs</B> library. Let's explain the stuff that we've used here.
  </M>
  <L>
    <Li>
      The "rxjs" library is tree-shakeable, so it means only imported, small
      functions will be bundled.
    </Li>
    <Li>
      This library provides reactivity and a lot of great for performance
      operators.
    </Li>
    <Li>It removes from us the need to maintain hard-to-implement code.</Li>
    <Li>It makes all async stuff much easier.</Li>
    <Li>
      It implements an observable pattern, in which we can subscribe to
      dedicated situations and react in our code.
    </Li>
  </L>
  <M>
    There is one more small stuff to do. Our hook will work now on the client
    side perfectly, but on the server side (Next.js) we'll see a warning about
    the usage of <B>useLayoutEffect</B> hook on server. How to fix that?
  </M>
  <M>
    We need to create a small util that is often called by developers as a{" "}
    <B>useIsomorphicLayoutEffect</B>.{" "}
  </M>
  <Code
    mode="static"
    lang="ts"
  >{`import { useEffect, useLayoutEffect } from 'react';
// On the server side, we'll use "useEffect", but on 
// the client "useLayoutEffect". Anyway, on server side 
// we cannot read real DOM information.
const useIsomorphicLayoutEffect =
  typeof window === 'undefined' ? useEffect : useLayoutEffect;
 
export { useIsomorphicLayoutEffect };
`}</Code>

<Summary label="Summary of the useScroll hook">
  <M>
    The hook created by us, contains great type-safety and it's safe to use on the
    client/server side. In addition, it provides developer hints when it will be used in an
    invalid way and protects us from performance problems due to scroll events.
  </M>
  <M>
    Nextly, it allows you to listen on both <B>x</B> and <B>y</B> axis scroll
    events. It's easy to extend - if you need other metadata you can just
    increase the interface properties.
  </M>
  <M>
    And what is the most important, we have tests - if you are curious just check them in the 
    final example.
