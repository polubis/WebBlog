  </Hint>
  <M>
    Sometimes we want to measure the <B>width</B>, <B>height</B>, and other
    properties when the user changes the viewport - imagine the browser is
    resized. For example, in <B>GIF</B> below, we need this feature to set state
    and change from preview to code editor automatically.{" "}

  <M>
    Doing it only with <B>@media</B> in <B>CSS</B> will provide unsync between
    the visible UI and the internal state of the feature. In the mentioned
    feature we want to give the user the possibility to change the current view,
    and we want to automatically set it when the viewport has a dedicated size.
    So, to achieve it we need to know the size of <B>window</B> or any other{" "}
    <B>HTML node</B> like <B>div</B>.
  </M>
  <M>
    That's why creating a reusable hook may be a good idea for such cases. In
    the following lesson, we'll create <B>useElementSize</B> hook, and we will
    discuss implementation details with possible use cases.{" "}

<Section>
  <XL>The getBoundingClientReact function</XL>
  <M>
    Before we start we need to choose a native function that allows us to read
    height or width of an element. <B>JavaScript</B> contains{" "}
    <B>getBoundingClientReact</B> function, which returns above mentioned and
    much more!

<Section>
  <XL>The ResizeObserver API</XL>
  <M>
    Ok, we know how to read metadata, but how to listen to resize events? We may
    use <B>ResizeObserver</B>. It allows us to specify the target and listen to
    situations when the size of any element changes. It returns the same object
    as the <B>getBoundingClientRect</B> function.
  </M>
  <Code
    mode="dynamic"

  <XL>API design phase</XL>
  <M>We'll use our hook in two ways:</M>
  <L ordered>
    <Li>with document.body element,</Li>
    <Li>with any other HTML node - like div, span, ...etc.</Li>
  </L>
  <Code

    linesCount={14}
  />
  <M>
    Before we start the implementation, let's add some type definitions for our
    hook in a separate file - <B>defs.ts</B>:{" "}
  </M>
  <Code
    mode="dynamic"
    lang="tsx"

    linesCount={47}
  />
  <M>
    You may asking yourself: "Why have we used <B>unions</B> to define a state
    shape?". So, if we are not able to detect the size, there is no point for
    allocating in memory 2 additional properties of an object - <B>height</B>{" "}
    and <B>width</B>. In addition, it will make easier for us to check whether
    the size has been already checked or not.{" "}

  <M>
    The developer experience will be much better, less memory allocated and
    we'll be protected from making a common mistake - reading the value which is
    not ready to be used.

  <M>
    At the beginning let's import previously defined types into a new file -{" "}
    <B>use-element-size.ts</B> and let's add the basic boilerplate that we need.
  </M>
  <Code
    mode="dynamic"
    lang="tsx"
    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polubis/Snippets-for-articles-and-lessons/main/React%20hooks%20spellbook/Element%20size%20measurement%20with%20useElementSize%20hook/7.tsx"
    linesCount={21}
  />
  <M>
    Now, just after the <B>component mount</B>, we need to assign the initial
    state and detect the current size of the element.{" "}
  </M>
  <Code
    added={[
      [1, 1],
      [11, 20],

    linesCount={23}

  <M>
    We've used weird <B>useIsomorphicLayoutEffect</B>. We need to read the data
    and be sure that the browser performed <B>paint</B> - that's why we need to
    use <B>useLayoutEffect</B> hook for that.
  </M>
  <M>
    However, if we use <B>useLayoutEffect</B> on the server side - <B>NextJS</B>
    , we'll see an error. To avoid that, we need a simple abstraction that when
    the code will be used on the server side, the <B>useEffect</B> will be used,
    in another case the <B>useLayoutEffect</B> will be used.{" "}

  <M>
    Okay, now when you use our hook on any component, the initial state will be
    assigned and you'll be able to use it inside your <B>JSX</B>. Unfortunately,
    still we need a resizing check and update when it happens. To achieve this
    we'll use <B>ResizeObserver</B> API mentioned before.{" "}
  </M>
  <Code
    mode="dynamic"
    lang="tsx"
    added={[
      [13, 13],
      [29, 29],
      [20, 27],
      [8, 8],
      [31, 34],
    ]}
    changed={[[]]}
    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polubis/Snippets-for-articles-and-lessons/main/React%20hooks%20spellbook/Element%20size%20measurement%20with%20useElementSize%20hook/010.tsx"
    linesCount={38}
  />
  <M>
    Now, when you open the browser and resize the window, the state will be
    updated. Still, there is a small problem - the event is called too often. We
    should have the option to reduce the amount of calls. For example, we may
    use a typical <B>debounce</B> mechanism for that. So, when user will resize
    the window, we'll wait and then we'll take only last emitted event.
  </M>
  <M>
    You may implement this mechanism on your own, use it from <B>lodash</B>, or
    another library. I'll use in this example the <B>RxJs</B> operators.{" "}
  </M>
  <Code
    mode="dynamic"
    lang="tsx"
    added={[
      [1, 1],
      [14, 18],
      [20, 33],
    ]}
    changed={[[46, 46]]}

    linesCount={60}
  />
  <M>
    Now, when we try to resize the default delay will be used to debounce
    events. So, the callbacks will trigger rerenders in rare cases.{" "}

<Summary label="The conclusions and thoughts">
  <M>
    We've created a really nice hook that is able to listen for <B>body</B> and
    any other <B>HTML node</B> resize event and update the metadata that we may
    use in our components or other hooks. The hook prevents us from making
    popular mistakes when working with not ready state and guides us by hand on
    how to use the attached metadata.{" "}
