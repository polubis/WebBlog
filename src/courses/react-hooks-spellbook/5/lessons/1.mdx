<Prelude label="The use cases for the useScrollHide hook">
  <M>Imagine you've <B>Modal</B> component and during display, you have double scroll. First is window scroll and the second scroll is inside <B>Modal</B>. It may cause weird UX and frustrating to use UI. The best approach to improve that is just disabling the scroll on <B>window</B> when <B>Modal</B> is displayed. </M>
  <M>To understand the use case check the following <B>GIF</B>: </M>

  <M>This hook may be used to hide/show scroll programmatically for <B>window</B> or other <B>HTML elements</B>. It may be useful when you create any component that appears on the screen and contains a scroll - <B>menu</B>, <B>select</B>, <B>dialog</B>, <B>alert</B>, ...etc.

  <XL>How to use the useScrollHide hook?</XL>
  <M>
    We'll use our hook in 2 scenarios: with <B>window</B> and with any other{" "}
    <B>HTML element</B>.
  </M>
  <Code
    mode="dynamic"
    lang="tsx"
    description="The overview of the hook API"

  <M>
    If we want to use the scroll hide mechanism and apply it to{" "}
    <B>HTML element</B>, we need to pass the type of this element to our hook.
  </M>
  <M>
    In addition, we have <B>2 methods</B> to programmatically maintain the
    scroll.

  <M>
    Let's start the explanation with  boilerplate for our hook.
  </M>
  <Code
mode="dynamic"
lang="ts"
description="The boilerplate setup"

<M>Now, we need a mechanism that determines what we should track (window or HTML element). We should pick the <B>HTML element</B> if the value of <B>ref</B> is assigned - different than <B>null</B>. Otherwise, it will be a <B>window</B>.</M>
<Code
mode="dynamic"
lang="tsx"
added={[[5,5]]}

linesCount={8}
/>
<M>We want to hide the scroll just after the component is mounted. So, we need the <B>effect</B>. It will work like this: </M>
<L>
  <Li>if the component is mounted - we'll call the 'hide' function to hide scroll,</Li>
  <Li>if the component is unmounted - we'll call the 'show' function to restore scroll.</Li>
</L>
<Code
mode="dynamic"
lang="tsx"
added={[[6,12]]}

linesCount={13}
/>
<M>We need to store initial styles for our target element in which we want to hide/show scroll. For that, we'll also use <B>ref</B> object. It's because it will store these values per hook usage and will not cause additional rerenders like <B>useState</B> hook. </M>
<Code
mode="dynamic"
lang="tsx"
added={[[1,1], [3,3], [5,7], [12,12]]}
description="Setup for initial style"

linesCount={14}
/>
<M>Why the <B>overflow</B> value is <B>auto</B> by default? If the target element (window or HTML element) will not have a <B>overflow</B>, we want to set this value to <B>auto</B> - to make the scroll working as before.</M>
<M>Last but not least, we need to implement <B>show</B> and <B>hide</B> functions.</M>
<Code
added={[[3,8], [10,14]]}
mode="dynamic"
lang="ts"
description="Adding show and hide functions"

linesCount={15}
/>
<M>In each, at the beginning we get an element - the window or HTML element. Next, we are assigning styles to hide and show scroll. </M>
<M>Now, it will work, but we're using <B>useEffect</B> to perform some <B>DOM</B> operations - reading values and changing styles. </M>
<M>We've used <B>useEffect</B>, but we should use <B>useLayoutEffect</B> which is designed for that case - it's executed after <B>browser repaints</B> our view - so we will be sure that our styles data is up to date.</M>

linesCount={5}
/>
<M>Last thing... Still, we need to take into consideration <B> server-side rendering</B>. Right now we'll have logged bad looking error/warning on server side (Next or Gatsby). To fix that we need to use abstraction for <B>useLayoutEffect</B> that blocks executing it on <B>server-side</B>. </M>

<Hint hasBg>
I'm using <B>useIsomorphicLayoutEffect</B> in almost all hooks that I implemented if I want to use <B>useLayoutEffect</B>.
