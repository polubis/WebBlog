<Prelude label="First interaction use cases">
  <M>
    Sometimes, you need to detect the <B>user's first interaction</B> in the
    application and perform specific actions. This could involve rendering a
    widget, logging an entry in the database via a dedicated API call, or other
    tasks. Performing these operations immediately after the application mounts
    - during the first render in <B>React</B> - may slow down your{" "}
    <B>Lighthouse</B> benchmark. If you prioritize performance, it's advisable
    to consider utilizing this mechanism.
  </M>
  <M>
    For example, consider a scenario where a user lands on your page that
    requires fetching data to display a pop-up widget. Without this mechanism,
    you would make a call every time the user refreshes the page, even if they
    don't need this data/widget. By implementing this mechanism, you load the
    required data only when the user truly "interacts" with the app, reducing
    costs and improving application performance metrics. This is possible
    because the additional code for the required operation can be lazy-loaded.
  </M>
  <M>
    In the <A href="https://4markdown.com/">https://4markdown.com/</A> app, we
    utilize it to load the <B>Firebase</B> library, which is relatively large,
    only after the user interacts with the app. This enhancement has boosted our
    benchmarks from <B>94%</B> to <B>100%</B>. Check out the <B>GIF</B> below to
    understand how it works:

  <XL>1. Detecting user interaction</XL>
  <M>
    Detecting the first user interaction varies between mobile and desktop
    devices. On mobile devices, it involves the use of a <B>touch event</B>,
    while on desktop devices, it relies on a <B>mouse move</B> event. Therefore,
    we require two distinct events and a mechanism to differentiate between them
    after detecting the initial user interaction.

<Section>
  <XL>2. Design of useOnInteraction hook</XL>
  <M>
    To avoid cluttering our component code with repetitive logic for detecting
    the first user interaction, we'll create a custom hook called{" "}
    <B>useOnInteraction</B>. Components will then simply consume this hook and
    execute the necessary operations based on the results.

  <XL>3. Implementing useOnInteraction hook</XL>
  <M>
    The implementation of the <B>useOnInteraction</B> hook involves utilizing{" "}
    <B>useState</B> to trigger a rerender when an interaction is detected, and
    the <B>useEffect</B> hook to listen to relevant events.
  </M>
  <Code
    mode="dynamic"
    lang="tsx"

    description="The useOnInteraction implementation"
  />
  <M>
    When interaction is detected, we remove the current listeners and skip
    adding new ones with a simple <B>if statement</B> at the beginning of the{" "}
    <B>useEffect</B> implementation.

<Summary label="Summary">
  <M>
    Now, you can listen for the first interaction and perform the necessary
    operations. I use this hook for <B>lazy loading</B> dedicated components or
    executing required calls/checks. For instance, it might involve checking the
    authorization status only after the user interacts with the app, preventing
    unnecessary calls to my API.
