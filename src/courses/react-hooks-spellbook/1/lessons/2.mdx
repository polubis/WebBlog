<Prelude>
  <M>Let's say you have a <B>simple screen with steps</B>. It can look more or less like the one in the gif below:

<M>
  We'll write a <B>useStepper hook</B> that will have the basic functionality to
  change the step and will protect us from potential bugs.
</M>

<M>
  In this hook we'll encapsulate common logic for changing steps, so later we
  don't have to repeat ourselves and we'll make it <B>type-safety</B>.

  <B>We want to avoid:</B>

    For a start, look at how we will use our hook. Pay attention to the hints
    that appear thanks to the TypeScript.

<Summary>
  <M>
    Now you know how to handle the steps on the user interface in an interesting
    way. The created solution protects against many basic mistakes that can be
    made when implementing such functionality.
  </M>
  <M>
    <M>
      It is worth noting that the logic itself is simple - the complexity is
      introduced by TypeScript (as always). So it is up to you whether you want
      to use this solution with or without TS.
