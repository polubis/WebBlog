<Prelude label="Why you see this long and weird error?">
<Hint hasBg>This article will be linked in other articles many times - this hook is used really often when writing SSR working hooks/components. </Hint>
<M><B>"The useLayoutEffect  does nothing on the server, because its effect cannot be encoded into the server renderer's output format. This will lead to a mismatch between the initial, non-hydrated UI and the intended UI. To avoid this, useLayoutEffect should only be used in components that render exclusively on the client."</B></M>
  <M>Why you see this error? The <B>useLayoutEffect</B> is designed for reading real <B>DOM</B> information from the browser environment (client-side). On server side, there is no <B>DOM</B>, so when we'll try to create our hooks/components and we'll use <B>useLayoutEffect</B> on the server, the initial expected result may be weird - aka buggy as hell. That's why frameworks skip calling this hook. </M>

  <Hint hasBg>In other frameworks like <B>Gatsby</B> the similar approach is used.</Hint>
  <Hint hasBg>The <B>useEffect</B> calls are also <B>skipped</B> on server-side. This hook is designed for <B>client-side</B> code, but that's not a part of this article.</Hint>

      if it's a server environment, you need to call empty function instead of

    I showed you two of the most popular names/implementations for this hook.
    What is important, you may avoid using this when you're sure that your code
    is executed only on the <B>client-side</B>. For example, it may happen when
    you use the <B>code splitting/lazy loading</B> technique.{" "}

<Summary label="Conclusions">
  <M>
    Now we know how to fix this weird warning and we know that{" "}
    <B>useLayoutEffect</B> and <B>useEffect</B> calls are skipped on the server
    side in all <B>SSR/SSG</B> frameworks. It happens because there is no option
    to access <B>browser DOM</B> object on the server side.{" "}
  </M>
  <M>
    In addition, we know that for <B>useLayoutEffect</B> there is a warning
    prompted during <B>build phase</B> or when a component will be dynamically
    rendered with <B>SSG</B> technique. So, when it will happen - just use our
    newly created, simple abstractions.{" "}
