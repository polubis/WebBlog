  <XL>Why?</XL>
  <M>
    Authorization on frontend can be tricky. The logic of it varies depending on
    what we use for authorization. Suppose you have three methods of
    authorization - <B>Google</B>, <B>Facebook</B> and the{" "}
    <B>usual login form</B>.
  </M>
  <M>
    For the application it should make no difference what kind of provider it
    is. So we need an abstraction that will give the application all the tools
    to authorize with any provider.
