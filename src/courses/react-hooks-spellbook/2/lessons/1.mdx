  <XL>Why?</XL>
  <M>
    Duplication of <B>logic for forms</B> from the perspective of different
    requirements is a bad idea. Especially validation.
  </M>
  <M>
    The <B>data model</B> is also important. After all, for each view it would
    be easier to use the same properties to describe the interface, rather than
    different ones.
  </M>
  <M>
    Therefore, it is worthwhile to enclose such a part of the application in a
    hook and then, if necessary, replace it with a library later.
