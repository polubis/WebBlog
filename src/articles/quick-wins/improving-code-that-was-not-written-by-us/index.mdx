  <M>
    During a project you will most likely cooperate with other developers. Each
    of them has a slightly different writing style. In addition, you might
    encounter situations where the code is duplicated or specific methods are
    missing.
  </M>
  <M>
    What if you had something to unify the API, add the missing methods and
    force developers to write consistent code?
  </M>
  <Hint hasBg>
    We will implement the List class using the facade pattern to create code
    which solves above problems.
  </Hint>

<Section>
  <XL>1. API design</XL>
  <M>
    We want our List class to have additional functionality - tracking a
    specific list item and reading this item at any time. Plus, we need a method
    that will allow us to replace a specific element.

  <XL>2. Mock implementation</XL>
  <M>
    Let’s create class which implements previously created interface. In TDD,
    throwing exceptions is a standard practice to indicate that they are not yet
    implemented.

<Section>
  <XL>3. Creation of test scenarios</XL>
  <M>
    Before starting the implementation, think about exactly how your methods
    should behave. We’re going write our test scenario. Thanks to this approach
    it is possible to locate more edge cases in the code.

  <XL>4. Implementing tests</XL>
  <M>
    Time for tests implementation. After this step, all tests are read. We
    created some helper functions and test user data which you can check inside
    mocks directory.

  <XL>5. Making tests green</XL>
  <M>
    Having the correct implementation, we can go to refactor later. In this
    article we skip this step.
  </M>
  <M>
    In the constructor, we assign initial values ​​and set the pointer. Then we
    implement specific methods that will move the pointer and return a new
    instance of the List. Additionally, we add a method to replace an element
    with an identifier or a pointer / index.

  <XL>6. Usage in React</XL>
  <M>
    No spread operators, no anonymous functions for data management, 100%
    immutability, separation of concerns, encapsulation and readable /
    consistent code as benefits of facade pattern.

<Summary>
  <M>I hope you enjoyed this quick win 🙂.</M>
  <M>
    Of course this is simple example but as you see sky is the limit and you can
    create your own facade for everything in your application.
