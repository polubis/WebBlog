title: useFetch hook
---

<Prelude>
  <M>
    Fetching and processing data from an API is one of the most repetitive
    activities in web applications.
  </M>
  <M>
    That's why it's a good idea to make sure that the code you write is
    readable, consistent and easy to understand for others.
  </M>
  <M>
    Don't count on developers. Everyone has different habits. It will be much
    easier to create an abstraction and encapsulate repetitive logic inside.
  </M>
  <M>
    So let's jump into <B>useFetch</B> hook creation process and see how it
    behaves in a real example.
  </M>
</Prelude>

<Section>
  <XL>1. What do you implement?</XL>
  <M>
    It will be a small app for loading users from a free API. You will be able
    to load users and display their avatars. Also, there will be an option to
    perform requests for details.
  </M>
  <M>
    In addition, when the request is still pending you will be able to cancel
    the operation to save some browser resources after clicking <B>Back</B>{" "}
    button.
  </M>

<Section>
  <XL>2. Looking at spaghetti</XL>
  <M>It works indeed, but the used approach is dirty like a mug.</M>
  <Code
    mode="dynamic"
    lang="tsx"
    description="I like pasta but what the **** is this?"
    linesCount={50}
    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polubis/useFetch-hook/main/snippets/spaghetti.tsx"
  />
  <M>
    Try to multiply it by the number of requests in the application or add
    another code - I wish you luck.
  </M>
  <M>
    Generally, you can hide this logic in something like <B>useUsersFetch</B> -
    but implementation inside will be the same.
  </M>
  <Code
    mode="dynamic"
    lang="tsx"
    description="Hidding dirty code"
    linesCount={57}
    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polubis/useFetch-hook/main/snippets/hide-in-use-fetch.tsx"
  />
  <M>
    In addition - it's only users fetch logic. Still, we need to do the same for
    user details.
  </M>
  <M>Problems with this code:</M>
  <List items="Flags - easy to add a bug, A lot to test, It's hard to determine what this code does on first look, Lack of single responsibility, You can access data property when it's not ready to be accessed, Repetitive approach and sensitive to a human mistake" />
  <Hint hasBg>Imagine the whole application written like that ðŸ˜º.</Hint>
</Section>

<Section>
  <XL>3. Can you do better?</XL>
  <M>
    Of course... Just look at the code below and try to understand it. I think
    it's obvious what is happening immediately.
  </M>
  <Code
    mode="dynamic"
    lang="tsx"
    description="Read the code like a good book"
    linesCount={37}
    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polubis/useFetch-hook/main/snippets/how-it-should-look-like.tsx"
  />
  <M>
    Look at if statements. Inside <B>useFetch</B> hook we implement later{" "}
    <B>exhaustiveness checking</B>. It will be discussed soon but in simple
    words - it prevents us from accessing properties when they aren't available
    and guide us by hand when writing conditional instructions.
  </M>
  <Image
    rolled
    src="/assets/use-fetch-hook/checking.gif"
    description="Typescript power"
  />
  <M>All benefits:</M>
  <List items="Less code = smaller bundle, Better readability, Option to develop similar features faster, Typesafety, Typescript support when writing if statements, Consistent code, Easy to test and easy to replace" />
</Section>

<Section>
  <XL>4. Understanding exhaustiveness checking</XL>
  <M>
    You must have seen the difference in code and complexity that we discussed
    earlier. Now you need to understand how to implement this mechanism in{" "}
    <B>Typescript</B>.
  </M>
  <M>
    It is simple - just create several types that have a common property and
    make the union of them.
  </M>
  <Code
    mode="dynamic"
    description="Union of types"
    lang="ts"
    linesCount={57}
    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polubis/useFetch-hook/main/snippets/exh-check.ts"
  />
  <M>
    Right now you are not able to access properties other than <B>type</B>{" "}
    without <B>if</B> statement. This protects you from potential bugs and
    prevents you from adding code in the "other" style.
  </M>
</Section>

<Section>
  <XL>5. Abort controller</XL>
  <M>
    Before we start implementation there is one more thing to explain -{" "}
    <B>AbortController</B> class.
  </M>
  <M>
    This class must be created one per request. Created instance exposes{" "}
    <B>signal</B> property and <B>abort</B> function. <B>Signal</B> must be
    passed to <B>fetch</B>.
  </M>
  <M>
    When you pass the signal property, then you can cancel the request via{" "}
    <B>abort</B> function. You can do it at any time - depends on your needs.
  </M>
  <Code
    mode="dynamic"
    description="Abort controlled"
    linesCount={48}
    lang="tsx"
    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polubis/useFetch-hook/main/snippets/abort-controller.tsx"
  />
  <M>
    In our case, we call <B>abort</B> all time when the <B>useEffect</B>{" "}
    function is executed.
  </M>
  <M>Also it's good to cancel:</M>
  <List items="Duplicated requests, When a user leaves the page, When components unmount, In any other case" />
  <M>
    When a request is aborted you can see it in the console and network tab.
  </M>
  <Image

    description="In console"
    src="/assets/use-fetch-hook/aborted.jpg"
  />
  <Image
    rolled
    description="In network tab"
    src="/assets/use-fetch-hook/cancelled.jpg"
  />
  <M>
    All of this will be possible by the usage of your <B>useFetch</B> hook.
  </M>
</Section>

<Section>
  <XL>6. Adding tests suites</XL>
  <M>
    Let's create <B>useFetch.ts</B> file and same file for tests. You will use{" "}
    <B>TDD</B>. You need to cover the following test scenarios with
    implementation.
  </M>
  <Code
    mode="dynamic"
    lang="ts"
    description="Test paths"
    linesCount={17}
    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polubis/useFetch-hook/main/snippets/tests-suites.test.ts"
  />
  <Hint hasBg>
    Test implementation is skipped. If you are interested - you can check it in
    this{" "}
    <A
      href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polubis/useFetch-hook/main/src/utils/useFetch.test.ts"
      outside
    >
      file
    </A>{" "}
    or in the example at the end.
  </Hint>
</Section>

<Section>
  <XL>7. Implementing useFetch</XL>
  <M>Firstly, let's start with interfaces.</M>
  <Code
    mode="dynamic"
    lang="ts"
    description="Some needed type definitions"
    linesCount={25}
    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polubis/useFetch-hook/main/snippets/type-defs.ts"
  />
  <M>
    Next, we need to create a hook and implement a handler function with a state
    management transition which includes the option to abort a request.
  </M>
  <Code
    mode="dynamic"
    lang="ts"
    description="Hook implemented"
    linesCount={47}
    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polubis/useFetch-hook/main/snippets/hook-final.ts"
  />
  <M>
    Nothing fancy in this code. You just make generic everything that we
    discussed before.
  </M>
</Section>

<Section>
  <XL>8. Create renderer</XL>
  <M>
    We can also improve rendering. Instead of several <B>if</B> statements - you
    can create a component for handling that.
  </M>
  <Code
    mode="dynamic"
    lang="tsx"
    description="Renderer for hiding ugly ifs"
    linesCount={50}
    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polubis/useFetch-hook/main/snippets/renderer.tsx"
  />
  <M>
    It simplifies rendering. Now it will be the same in the whole application.
  </M>
</Section>

<Section>
  <XL>9. Implementing our small app</XL>
  <M>
    Let's create two hooks that wrap logic for loading users and user details.
    These hooks will use your newly created <B>useFetch</B> hook.
  </M>
  <Code
    mode="dynamic"
    lang="ts"
    description="Two facade hooks"
    linesCount={39}
    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polubis/useFetch-hook/main/snippets/two-facade-hooks.ts"
  />
  <M>
    Now in <B>UsersService</B> we can use <B>signal</B> in <B>fetch</B>.
  </M>
  <Code
    mode="dynamic"
    lang="ts"
    description="Typical service logic"
    linesCount={12}
    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polubis/useFetch-hook/main/snippets/UsersService.ts"
  />
  <M>
    Right now it's time for the final step. Just use created hooks in the
    component and display dedicated UI.
  </M>
  <Code
    mode="dynamic"
    lang="tsx"
    description="Already done!"
    linesCount={80}
    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polubis/useFetch-hook/main/snippets/final.tsx"
  />

<Summary>
  <M>I hope you enjoyed this quick win ðŸ™‚.</M>
  <M>
    Together we explored a pretty interesting topic of creating abstractions in
    your code base and dealing with unneeded requests. Right now you can boost
    your work a little bit.
  </M>
