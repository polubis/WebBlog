<Prelude>
  <M>
    When writing functional code, you can get the impression that it is very
    difficult to understand at first. I agree with that.
  </M>
  <M>
    However, such code has many interesting features that can be used in
    everyday work. Once you have mastered the basics, you will begin to notice
    how powerful this tool is.

<Section>
  <XL>1. Looking at not pure function</XL>
  <M>
    This function is not pure because it has side effects, modifies a variable
    outside scope, returns different values ​​each time and modifies input
    parameters.
  </M>

<Section>
  <XL>2. Pure function</XL>
  <M>
    A pure function always returns the same values ​​for the same arguments,
    does not modify input parameters and has no side effects like asynchronous
    code or changing something outside its range.
  </M>

<Section>
  <XL>3. Function composition</XL>
  <M>
    It's just passing one function result to other functions. Great composition
    is always implemented with pure functions.

  />

<Section>
  <XL>4. Closure</XL>
  <M>
    A closure occurs when a function returns another function, and this function
    may use the value contained in the "parent" function.
  </M>

<Section>
  <XL>5. Currying</XL>
  <M>
    In simple words, transforming one multi-argument function to many unary
    functions. We can do it ourselves or write a function to do it for us.
  </M>

<Summary>
  <M>I hope the basics of functional programming are now easy for you 🙂.</M>
  <M>
    Play with the example code. Practice is necessary to understand it
    completely and to notice the benefits.
