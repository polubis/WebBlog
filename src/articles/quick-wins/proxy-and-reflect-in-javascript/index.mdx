<Prelude>
  <M>
    Have you ever wondered how to interact with code written by other
    programmers without intruding on their code?
  </M>
  <M>
    There is something called <B>metaprogramming</B>. Thanks to it you can
    achieve it.
  </M>
  <M>
    Two objects will help you: <B>Proxy</B> and <B>Reflect</B>. Today you will
    learn how, when, and where you can use them to master a powerful technique.
  </M>
  <Hint hasBg>
    Metaprogramming is not invented by <B>Meta</B> company 🤡.
  </Hint>
</Prelude>

<Section>
  <XL>1. Metaprogramming</XL>
  <M>
    To start talking about metaprogramming, you need to answer the question:
    what is data and code? Every programming language has both of these but what
    do they mean, exactly?
  </M>
  <M>
    <B>Data</B> can be for example:
  </M>
  <List items="number, symbol, array, object, string" />
  <M>
    <B>Code</B> is an expression - an instruction to be executed on this data.
    It can be:{" "}
    <B hasBg fullBg>
      const result = 1 + (2 * 3)
    </B>
    .
  </M>
  <M>
    At first glance, you can say that it is a mathematical expression, and this
    is indeed the case if we are talking about the field of mathematics.
    However, according to the presented approach, we will consider it in two
    ways:
  </M>
  <List items="by data: '1 + (2 * 3)' - is a string!, by code: '1 + (2 * 3)' - is it code snippet? Then it is 7!" />
  <M>
    From this it follows that the same representation of an expression can have
    different interpretations. This approach is what metaprogramming is all
    about.
  </M>
  <M>
    Knowing this is a powerful tool for building data and expressions. It allows
    us to create functions that multiply data which means we can write programs
    that write programs. It is a certain level of abstraction.
  </M>
  <M>To illustrate this more easily, let's discuss it with this example:</M>
  <Code
    description="For loop"
    src="/snippets/proxy-and-reflect-in-javascript/for.js"
  />
  <M>
    According to the data it is a plain text, but according to the code it is
    something to be interpreted as an instruction, so:
  </M>
  <Code
    description="For as set of instructions"
    src="/snippets/proxy-and-reflect-in-javascript/for-pseudo.txt"
  />
  <M>
    Congratulations, you have just successfully interpreted a piece of code
    through metaprogramming!
  </M>
</Section>

<Section>
  <XL>2. Proxy pattern explained</XL>
  <M>
    A <B>proxy</B> is a <B>structural design pattern</B> that allows you to
    create a proxy object in place of another object. A proxy is a kind of
    guardian that protects access to the original object, or changes its
    behavior.
  </M>
  <M>
    How do you translate this into a simple example from life?... Cash! Cash is
    the physical representation of the capital placed in your bank account. But
    what about it? Have you ever used a credit card?
  </M>
  <M>
    Well, think about it. Credit card is an actually proxy for your cash in the
    bank. You don't need to physically have paper money with you to buy
    something. Both of these entities implement the same interface (you can
    perform an action with them - pay). At the same time, you are actually
    operating an object that protects another object (in the bank).
  </M>
</Section>

<Section>
  <XL>3. Proxy in JavaScript</XL>
  <M>Let's start with a simple example for reference:</M>
  <Code
    description="Your first proxy"
    src="/snippets/proxy-and-reflect-in-javascript/first-proxy.js"
  />
  <M>
    As you can see, we have overwritten the <B>get</B> mechanism for reading the
    properties for the <B>ProtectedObject</B> without interfering with its
    implementation. Now reading a property separated by the symbol "_", you are
    able to transform several properties into a string of characters.
  </M>
  <M>
    Even more can be achieved by overwriting <B>set</B> behavior. Just look at
    this:
  </M>
  <Code
    description="Strict"
    src="/snippets/proxy-and-reflect-in-javascript/set-change.js"
  />
  <M>
    We added validation which makes sense. Who normally tries to add something
    to an object with a certain shape?
  </M>
  <Hint hasBg>
    When does a proxy make sense? The proxy should totally replace the target
    object everywhere. No one should ever reference the target object after it
    got proxied. Otherwise it’s easy to mess up.
  </Hint>
</Section>

<Section>
  <XL>4. Proxy use cases</XL>
  <M>Logging access to an object:</M>
  <Code
    description="Logging properties"
    src="/snippets/proxy-and-reflect-in-javascript/logging-access-to-obj.js"
  />
  <M>Custom error handling/validation:</M>
  <Code
    description="Cool validation"
    src="/snippets/proxy-and-reflect-in-javascript/validation.js"
  />
  <M>Protect the object field:</M>
  <Code
    description="Like a guard"
    src="/snippets/proxy-and-reflect-in-javascript/guard.js"
  />
  <M>Lazy initialization:</M>
  <Code
    description="Lazy"
    src="/snippets/proxy-and-reflect-in-javascript/lazy.js"
  />
</Section>

<Section>
  <XL>5. What is Reflection?</XL>
  <M>
    Reflection is a closely related concept to object-oriented programming.
    Among other things, it is used to check the properties of a{" "}
    <B>class/object/method</B>. This technique allows building more dynamic
    functionality that is native to a particular programming language.
  </M>
  <M>
    Languages that use this functionality are able to modify their own
    environment. So the use of reflection should be thoughtful and used only in
    specific cases to avoid messy effects.
  </M>
</Section>
<Section>
  <XL>6. Reflect feature in JavaScript</XL>
  <M>
    <B>Reflect</B> is a Javascript native object that provides methods same as
    proxy feature. It is not a functional object, so its methods are static (not
    constructable). What does this mean? We can't create an instance of a
    Reflect object through the <B>new</B> operator or call it like a function.
  </M>
  <M>
    So which approach should I use? In my opinion: <B>both</B>.
  </M>
  <M>
    Proxy provides us with a number of options for changing an object's behavior
    during particular actions, while Reflect gives us access to their default
    behavior.
  </M>
  <M>It is a modified example "Protect the object field":</M>
  <Code
    description="Guard but with Reflect"
    src="/snippets/proxy-and-reflect-in-javascript/reflect-guard.js"
  />
  <M>Simpler? Clearer? Without an additional condition? Of course it is.</M>
  <M>
    Besides, the Reflect object provides us with a lot of functionality, which
    can be categorized as "syntax sugar".
  </M>
</Section>

<Section>
  <XL>7. Reflect use cases</XL>
  <M>Need to find out if an object has a field?</M>
  <Code
    description="Searching..."
    src="/snippets/proxy-and-reflect-in-javascript/find-field.js"
  />
  <M>Need to return all the keys of an object?</M>
  <Code
    description="Keys list"
    src="/snippets/proxy-and-reflect-in-javascript/keys-in-obj.js"
  />
  <M>Want to add a new field? No problem!</M>
  <Code
    description="Adding field"
    src="/snippets/proxy-and-reflect-in-javascript/new-field.js"
  />
</Section>

<Summary>
  <M>
    I hope you now understand Proxy and Reflect 🧑‍💻. I must say, they are
    tricky, yet useful and powerful.
  </M>
  <M>
    Next time when you see an ugly, old legacy code remember that you have these
    API's and there may be a good use case for them.

    and good health!
