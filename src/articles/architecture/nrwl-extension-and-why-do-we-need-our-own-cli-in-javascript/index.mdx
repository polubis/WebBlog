<Prelude>
  <M>
    Developers commonly acquire <B>CLI</B> skills across diverse technologies.{" "}
    <B>CLI's</B> are integral to tech stacks, automate tasks like code
    generation, building, and dependency management. While often tied to
    specific technologies, <B>CLIs</B> can serve broader purposes within a team
    or project, streamlining <B>Continuous Integration</B> processes. This
    article explores the advantages of this approach.
  </M>
</Prelude>

<Section>
  <XL>Why custom CLI?</XL>
  <M>
    As mentioned above, <B>CLIs</B> automate work with specific technologies by
    executing tasks from the console. During development, tasks extend beyond
    technology-specific ones, encompassing <B>organization-wide</B>,{" "}
    <B>team-centric</B>, and <B>project-specific</B> aspects. The main benefits
    of creating a <B>custom CLI</B> within an organization or project include:
  </M>
  <M>
    ⛽ <B>Efficiency Boost</B>: The CLI empowers streamlined task execution
    through single commands or scripts, expediting work. Its prowess lies in the
    swift and effortless handling of repetitive tasks, translating to
    considerable time savings.
  </M>
  <M>
    <B>🎡 Reproducibility</B>: CLI ensures precise process replication,
    eliminating manual step execution. A consolidated script captures all steps,
    enabling effortless, consistent reruns of the same sequence of actions.
  </M>
  <M>
    <B>🔀 Sharing</B>: CLI fosters collaboration by allowing easy sharing with
    team members. Ensuring uniform access to tools and procedures enhances
    teamwork consistency, mitigating errors arising from tool disparities.
  </M>
  <M>

  <XL>Understanding executors in NX</XL>
  <M>
    <B>NRWL Extension (NX)</B> empowers monorepo creation for <B>JavaScript</B>{" "}
    projects, integrating diverse technologies via plugins. Notably, a plugin
    facilitates custom plugin creation, enabling code generation and actions
    (build, test, format, etc...). These tasks operate in a <B>Node.js</B>{" "}
    environment, resembling project functionalities. Executable from both{" "}
    <B>NX Console</B> and the terminal, it effectively forms a CLI within the
    project.
  </M>
  <M>
    Let's start from installing dedicated <B>@nrwl/nx-plugin@latestpet</B>{" "}
    plugin. Then, we need to generate our own plugin code with the following
    command: <B>nx g @nrwl/nx-plugin:plugin [my-plugin-name]</B>.
  </M>
  <M>
    Now, let's explore <B>Task Executors</B>. To execute commands in the
    terminal, use <B>nx run [project] [command]</B> or{" "}
    <B>nx [command] [project]</B>. Here, <B>project</B> refers to the project in
    the <B>monorepo</B>, and <B>command</B> signifies the <B>NodeJS</B> task to
    be run.
  </M>
  <M>
    Furthermore, for <B>production</B> or <B>testing</B> environments, customize
    configurations:{" "}
    <B>nx [command] [project] --configuration=[configuration]</B>.
  </M>
  <M>
    Moreover, additional parameters are adaptable:{" "}
    <B>nx [command] [project] --[myCustomParam]=[myCustomParamValue]</B>.
  </M>
</Section>

<Section>
  <XL>Creating own executor in NX</XL>
  <M>
    To implement the specified command, use:{" "}
    <B>nx generate @nrwl/nx-plugin:executor [check] --project=[my-plugin]</B>.
    Here, <B>[my-plugin]</B> represents the previously created plugin, and{" "}
    <B>[check]</B> signifies the task name.
  </M>
  <M>
    Upon execution, the repository should exhibit the following folder/file
    structure:
  </M>
  <Image
    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polubis/Snippets-for-articles-and-lessons/main/NRWL%20extension%20and%20why%20do%20we%20need%20our%20own%20cli%20in%20JavaScript/1.jpg"
    description="The folders/files structure"
  />
  <M>
    The central configuration file, <B>schema.json</B>, acts as the primary{" "}
    <B>executor scheme</B> file, detailing crucial metadata for your executor.
    This includes parameter descriptions for the dedicated task, which may be
    optional, with options for selecting multiple or specific values.
  </M>
  <Code
    mode="dynamic"
    lang="json"
    description="The schema.json file"
    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polubis/Snippets-for-articles-and-lessons/main/NRWL%20extension%20and%20why%20do%20we%20need%20our%20own%20cli%20in%20JavaScript/1.json"
    linesCount={10}
  />
  <M>
    The foundational logic resides in the <B>executor.ts</B> file.
  </M>
  <Code
    mode="dynamic"
    lang="ts"
    description="The executor.ts file"

    linesCount={15}
  />
  <M>
    In the implementation, export a function returning an <B>object</B> with a{" "}
    <B>success</B> flag indicating the completion status. The function takes
    options passed via the <B>CLI</B> as the first argument and the{" "}
    <B>context of execution</B> (indicating the triggered project) as the second
    parameter.
  </M>
  <M>
    The final step involves assigning the task to a specific project, achievable
    within the <B>project.json</B> file under the <B>target section</B>.

  <M>
    Execute the task by using <B>nx run [my-project]:[check]</B> command.

  <XL>Understanding code generators</XL>
  <M>
    Generators offer a streamlined approach to automating numerous tasks
    integral to your programming workflow. Whether it involves crafting
    templates for components and functionalities, ensuring libraries are
    generated and organized with precision, or updating configuration files,
    generators play a pivotal role in standardizing these processes with a
    reliable and consistent methodology.
  </M>
  <M>There are three main types of generators:</M>
  <M>
    <B>
      🛫 Generators that expand the project code during the installation of
      plugin
    </B>
  </M>
  <M>
    Such generators are invoked when executing the command:{" "}
    <B>npm i [plugin]</B>.
  </M>
  <M>
    <B>🛠️ Local generators</B>
  </M>
  <M>
    Generators that create templates for components, services, functionalities,
    etc... They've following invocation schema:{" "}
    <B>nx generate [plugin]:[generator-name] [options]</B>.
  </M>
  <M>
    <B>🚀 Update generators</B>
  </M>
  <M>
    Invoked by <B>Nx plugins</B> during their updates to keep configuration
    files in sync with the latest tool versions. This generator is called when
    executing the command: <B>nx migrate [plugin]</B>.
  </M>
</Section>

<Section>
  <XL>Creating own NX generator</XL>
  <M>
    You need to execute following command:{" "}
    <B>
      nx generate @nrwl/nx-plugin:generator [my-generator] --project=[my-plugin]
    </B>
    , where the <B>[my-plugin]</B> is the name of previously created plugin and
    the <B>[my-generator]</B> is the name of generator.
  </M>
  <M>The generator will create a project file structure like this:</M>
  <Image
    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polubis/Snippets-for-articles-and-lessons/main/NRWL%20extension%20and%20why%20do%20we%20need%20our%20own%20cli%20in%20JavaScript/2.jpg"
    description="The folders/files structure"
  />
  <M>
    The <B>generator.ts</B> file contains the entire logic of the generator.
    This file includes a function that is invoked to perform manipulations on
    the file system tree. The <B>schema.json</B> file contains a description of
    the generator, available options, validation information, and default values
    (similarly to an executor).
  </M>
  <Code
    mode="dynamic"
    lang="tsx"
    description="The generator.ts file"
    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polubis/Snippets-for-articles-and-lessons/main/NRWL%20extension%20and%20why%20do%20we%20need%20our%20own%20cli%20in%20JavaScript/4.ts"
    linesCount={10}
  />
  <M>
    The <B>tree</B> parameter represents the file structure and enables the
    removal, addition, and editing of files. Devkit provides various tools to
    facilitate working with files. For instance, in the above example, the{" "}
    <B>installPackageTask</B> function installs Node packages. Additionally,
    within our custom generator, we can leverage other generators. The{" "}
    <B>libraryGenerator</B> function, for instance, creates a library based on
    another generator.
  </M>
  <Code
    mode="dynamic"
    lang="json"
    description="The schema.json file"
    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polubis/Snippets-for-articles-and-lessons/main/NRWL%20extension%20and%20why%20do%20we%20need%20our%20own%20cli%20in%20JavaScript/5.json"
    linesCount={16}
  />
  <M>
    The <B>$default</B> object is used to read command-line arguments passed to
    the generator. To run the generator created in this way, use the command
    line as follows:{" "}
    <B>nx generate @myorg/[my-plugin]:[my-generator] [mylib]</B>.
  </M>
</Section>

<Section>
  <XL>Adding packages on npm</XL>
  <M>
    Within the <B>NRWL Extension</B>, we can also create an <B>NPM </B> package
    that serves as a CLI with functionalities independent of a specific project.
    Such a CLI can provide standardization across teams or even the entire
    organization, including:
  </M>
  <L>
    <Li>
      ⛴️ setting up the work environment, installing the appropriate versions of
      tools, consistent with those used by other developers,
    </Li>
    <Li>
      🛸 creating projects according to the established schema used in the
      project.
    </Li>
  </L>

<Section>
  <XL>How to create own NPM package?</XL>
  <M>
    To create a <B>JavaScript</B> library, use the command:{" "}
    <B>nx generate @nrwl/workspace:library [my-cli] --buildable</B>.
  </M>
  <M>
    To facilitate passing arguments to the console, we can use the additional
    NPM package <B>yargs</B>. Install this tool with the command:{" "}
    <B>npm install yargs</B>.
  </M>
  <M>
    In the library folder, create a <B>bin</B> directory, and within it, create
    a file named <B>my-cli.js</B> with the following content:
  </M>
  <Code
    mode="dynamic"
    lang="jsx"
    description="The my-cli.js file"
    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polubis/Snippets-for-articles-and-lessons/main/NRWL%20extension%20and%20why%20do%20we%20need%20our%20own%20cli%20in%20JavaScript/6.js"
    linesCount={2}
  />
  <M>
    This allows referencing the CLI source, which will be located at the path{" "}
    <B>src/lib/cli.js</B>. The content of such a source could look like this:
  </M>
  <Code
    mode="dynamic"
    lang="tsx"
    description="The file under 'src/lib/cli.js'"
    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polubis/Snippets-for-articles-and-lessons/main/NRWL%20extension%20and%20why%20do%20we%20need%20our%20own%20cli%20in%20JavaScript/7.js"
    linesCount={17}
  />
  <M>
    This configuration provides us with the <B>init command</B>, with the name
    parameter <B>(alias n)</B>, calling the <B>workspaceInit</B> function, which
    can contain the logic for creating a project. For example, initializing an{" "}
    <B>NX workspace</B>.
  </M>
  <M>
    Before publishing the library in the <B>NPM registry</B>, we just need to
    configure it appropriately.
  </M>
  <Code
    mode="dynamic"
    lang="json"
    description="The package.json file"
    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polubis/Snippets-for-articles-and-lessons/main/NRWL%20extension%20and%20why%20do%20we%20need%20our%20own%20cli%20in%20JavaScript/8.json"
    linesCount={14}
  />
  <M>
    This configuration allows, after publishing and globally installing the NPM
    package, to use your custom CLI by executing the following command in the
    command line: <B>my-cli init -—name=[new-project]</B>.
