title: Modular architecture for medium frontend apps
---

<Prelude>
  <M>
    There is nothing more beautiful in a developer's career than{" "}
    <B>well-designed</B> architecture.
  </M>
  <M>
    Good architecture is easy to recognize. Ask yourself simple questions. Is
    what I'm doing obvious? Is it repeatable? Doesn't my work block others?
  </M>
  <M>
    If all the answers are true, then you are working with a{" "}
    <B>well-designed</B> architecture.
  </M>
  <M>What it means in practice? Together we will find the answer.</M>
</Prelude>

<Section>
  <XL>1. The problem</XL>
  <M>
    Let's say you have a simple feature to implement. It will be loading users
    and displaying loader/error based on API response.
  </M>
  <Img
    border
    src="/assets/modular-architecture-for-medium-frontend-apps/app.gif"
    description="Small demo"
  />
  <M>
    Your code may look like the code you are about to see. If that's the case,
    you'll have problems that show up late, or to be more precise, as new
    functionality is added.
  </M>
  <Snippet
    linesCount={62}
    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polubis/Modular-architecture-for-medium-frontend-apps/main/snippets/no-layers.tsx"
    description="A messy solution"
  />
  <M>
    The issue will grow with the amount of functionality and the number of
    developers in the project.
  </M>
  <M>
    Such an approach is vulnerable to changes in requirements and it violates
    the <B>open/closed</B> and <B>single responsibility principle</B> from{" "}
    <B>SOLID</B>.
  </M>
  <Img
    border
    src="/assets/modular-architecture-for-medium-frontend-apps/1-layer.jpg"
    description="Your current architecture diagram"
  />
  <M>Let's refactor this code and design real architecture step by step.</M>
  <Hint hasBg>
    If you write an entire application like this, you have to reckon with the
    fact that it will not be stable and friendly to changes in business
    requirements.
  </Hint>
</Section>

<Section>
  <XL>2. Logic/presentation</XL>
  <M>
    Each application should have layers with clearly defined relations. When I
    say layers, I mean code fragments that are logically related to each other
    and recur across different functionalities.
  </M>
  <M>
    An example of such a layer could be logic for <B>API requests</B> or{" "}
    <B>business logic</B>. In addition to identifying it, you still need to name
    it somehow, create abstractions and design relations.
  </M>
  <M>
    In frontend applications, we can easily separate two layers -{" "}
    <B>logic and presentation</B>.
  </M>
  <Img
    border
    src="/assets/modular-architecture-for-medium-frontend-apps/lp.jpg"
    description="Now you have 2 layers"
  />
  <Snippet
    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polubis/Modular-architecture-for-medium-frontend-apps/main/snippets/2-layers.tsx"
    description="2 layers in code"
    linesCount={63}
  />
  <M>
    To be honest - it's not enough. The presentation can be split into
    additional layers and the same for logic. You should achieve this because if
    not - you are not able to reuse code.
  </M>
</Section>

<Section>
  <XL>3. Design phase</XL>
  <M>Firstly, check this diagram.</M>
  <Img
    border
    src="/assets/modular-architecture-for-medium-frontend-apps/a-final.jpg"
    description="Modular architecture diagram"
  />
  <M>
    These blue boxes represent features. Each functionality should take
    advantage of this structure and relations. These rules are crucial when the
    solution is growing üêç.
  </M>
  <M>
    This approach gives us a division of application code and generic code that
    can be used in other solutions. Also, you can easily publish libraries via{" "}
    <B>npm</B> or migrate to <B>monorepo</B> later.
  </M>
</Section>

<Section>
  <XL>4. Libraries</XL>
  <M>
    First, let's create some components and place them in the <B>ui</B>{" "}
    directory. This library will store purely presentation components, you can
    treat it as a <B>design system</B> implementation.
  </M>
  <Snippet
    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polubis/Modular-architecture-for-medium-frontend-apps/main/src/libs/ui/avatar/Avatar.tsx"
    description="Avatar component"
    linesCount={13}
  />
  <Snippet
    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polubis/Modular-architecture-for-medium-frontend-apps/main/src/libs/ui/avatars-grid/AvatarsGrid.tsx"
    description="AvatarsGrid component"
    linesCount={27}
  />
  <M>
    Next, we will create a <B>development-kit</B> library that will store
    generic logic to handle API requests, rendering and anything that will be
    useful in various applications.
  </M>
  <Snippet
    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polubis/Modular-architecture-for-medium-frontend-apps/main/src/libs/development-kit/useFetch.ts"
    description="Generic hook for fetching"
    linesCount={60}
  />
  <Snippet
    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polubis/Modular-architecture-for-medium-frontend-apps/main/src/libs/development-kit/Renderer.tsx"
    description="Render handler"
    linesCount={30}
  />
  <M>
    Now when you create another app, you already have some base - design system
    and a set of useful features that speed up the work.
  </M>
  <Hint hasBg>
    If you are interested about <B>useFetch</B> hook you can check{" "}

    article.
  </Hint>
</Section>

<Section>
  <XL>5. Features</XL>
  <M>
    Let's start with the <B>service</B> layer that will be responsible for{" "}
    encapsulating the logic, performing API requests and carrying out the
    necessary data mapping.
  </M>
  <Snippet
    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polubis/Modular-architecture-for-medium-frontend-apps/main/src/features/users/services/users.service.ts"
    description="Now you can fetch users"
    linesCount={51}
  />
  <M>
    Now, look at the next layer - <B>logic</B>. We will use <B>useFetch</B>{" "}
    generic hook to implement users fetch.
  </M>
  <Snippet
    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polubis/Modular-architecture-for-medium-frontend-apps/main/src/features/users/logic/use-users.ts"
    description="Handling fetch users"
    linesCount={13}
  />
  <M>
    Logic done. Now it's time for the next layer - <B>components</B>, which can
    be used only inside this application. This layer can use models from the
    application domain.
  </M>
  <Snippet
    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polubis/Modular-architecture-for-medium-frontend-apps/main/src/features/users/components/users-list/users-list.component.tsx"
    description="Rendering users list"
    linesCount={42}
  />
  <M>
    It's time to glue everything with <B>container</B>. The layer that is
    supposed to bind the <B>logic</B> to the <B>component</B>.
  </M>
  <Snippet
    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polubis/Modular-architecture-for-medium-frontend-apps/Showcase/snippets/users.container.tsx"
    description="Looks simple?"
    linesCount={8}
  />
  <M>
    Last layer will be a <B>module</B>. A starting point for using the
    functionality. Here you can add things like <B>lazy loading</B> or{" "}
    <B>authorization</B> logic.
  </M>
  <Snippet
    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polubis/Modular-architecture-for-medium-frontend-apps/main/snippets/users.module.tsx"
    description="Here everything starts"
    linesCount={5}
  />
  <Hint hasBg>
    For easier recognition of individual layers, you can add a post fix to the
    file name - <B>Angular</B> is doing that and me too.
  </Hint>
</Section>

<Section>
  <XL>6. A few doubts</XL>
  <M>
    What about the situation when module <B>A</B> should consume something
    available in module <B>B</B>? It will probably happen when you would like to
    implement an authorization mechanism in the app or something similar.
  </M>
  <M>
    You can use the same approach as in <B>libs</B> directory. Just create{" "}
    <B>shared</B> folder and put there all reusable stuff connected with
    application.
  </M>
  <Img
    border
    src="/assets/modular-architecture-for-medium-frontend-apps/a-final4x.png"
    description="Architecture with shared module"
  />
</Section>

<Section>
  <XL>7. Adding authorization</XL>
  <M>
    Let's imagine a situation when <B>UsersModule</B> is a protected view. Only
    authorized users can access it. Check the gif below to understand how it
    should work.
  </M>
  <Img
    border
    src="/assets/modular-architecture-for-medium-frontend-apps/app-final.gif"
    description="Authorization feature"
  />
  <M>
    To access authorization state in different modules and be able to trigger
    authorization we need <B>Context API</B> from <B>React</B> and{" "}
    <B>AuthModule</B> itself. This stuff will be added to <B>shared</B>{" "}
    directory.
  </M>
  <M>
    As before we will split it into layers to achieve goals. Firstly, we add
    service.
  </M>
  <Snippet
    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polubis/Modular-architecture-for-medium-frontend-apps/main/src/shared/auth/services/auth.service.ts"
    description="Authorization service"
    linesCount={54}
  />
  <M>Next, we need authorization logic.</M>
  <Snippet
    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polubis/Modular-architecture-for-medium-frontend-apps/main/src/shared/auth/logic/auth.tsx"
    description="Context used"
    linesCount={45}
  />
  <M>
    It's time for <B>module</B>. It groups the whole feature.
  </M>
  <Snippet
    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polubis/Modular-architecture-for-medium-frontend-apps/main/src/shared/auth/auth.module.tsx"
    description="Module is ultra simple"
    linesCount={5}
  />
  <M>
    Now we need to wrap our entire application with <B>AuthModule</B>. Now you
    can use authorization!
  </M>
  <Snippet
    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polubis/Modular-architecture-for-medium-frontend-apps/main/src/index.tsx"
    description="App wrapped"
    linesCount={22}
  />
  <M>
    Last step - just consume authorization API via <B>useAuthContext</B> hook
    and decide what should be displayed.
  </M>
  <Snippet
    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polubis/Modular-architecture-for-medium-frontend-apps/main/src/features/users/containers/users.container.tsx"
    description="Consuming auth API"
    linesCount={26}
  />
</Section>

<Section>
  <XL>8. When to use?</XL>
  <M>
    Consider using this architecture when at least 2 or 3 of these points are
    truthy.
  </M>
  <List items="It's single page application, There is a small amount of shared state across components, Application is small/medium size, Your team is familiar with these architectural concepts" />

<Summary>
  <M>
    I hope you enjoyed my architectural proposal. It's mostly based on{" "}
    <B>Angular's</B> one.
  </M>
  <M>
    It's not a perfect solution - as always it depends on the project. However,
    you have the next skill in your spellbook and you should be able to use this
    kind of approach.
  </M>
  <M>
    Feel free to contact me if you have any questions/proposals. Have a nice day
    and good health!
