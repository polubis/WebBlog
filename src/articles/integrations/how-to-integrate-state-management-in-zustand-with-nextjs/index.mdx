<Prelude label="What we will achieve?">
  <M>
    The <B>NextJS</B> is a real game changer in the web ecosystem. However,
    integration with third-party libraries for state management like{" "}
    <B>Zustand</B> or <B>Redux</B> may be challenging. That's why today, we'll
    integrate <B>Next.js</B> app with <B>Zustand</B>, and at the end, you will
    know how to manage your state, keep it synced with the server and manage
    effectively.
  </M>
</Prelude>

<Section>
  <XL>Server/client state synchronization problem</XL>
  <M>
    Check the following code snippet which shows the difference in state
    returned from the <B>server</B> and the initial <B>client</B> state.{" "}

  <M>
    In <B>console.log</B> statements we have different values for counter
    variables from the <B>server</B> and <B>client</B>. This is a big problem,
    our application will be buggy as hell... So, we need to:
  </M>
  <L ordered>
    <Li>read the state from the server on the client before hydration,</Li>
    <Li>
      replace the Zustand store state - make synchronization between
      server/client.
    </Li>
  </L>

    When you try to run this code, you'll get the following error from{" "}

  <Hint hasBg>
    <B>Hydration</B> refers to the process of taking a{" "}
    <B>server-rendered React application</B> and making it{" "}
    <B>interactive on the client-side</B>. NextJS combines server-side rendering
    (SSR) with client-side rendering (CSR) to improve the performance and user
    experience of web applications
  </Hint>
</Section>

<Section>
  <XL>Synchronizing state for server/client</XL>
  <M>
    We need to sync the state before the <B>hydration</B>. Our{" "}
    <B>useCounterStore</B> hook created by <B>create</B> function from{" "}
    <B>Zustand</B>, exposes static method to change the state - <B>setState</B>.
  </M>
  <Code
    mode="dynamic"
    lang="tsx"
    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polubis/Snippets-for-articles-and-lessons/main/How%20to%20integrate%20state%20management%20in%20Zustand%20with%20NextJS/static-change.tsx"
    linesCount={2}
  />
  <M>
    The state change done in <B>Zustand</B> happens immediately. It's not{" "}
    <B>async</B> operation - you may understand it as a simple variable
    change.{" "}
  </M>
  <M>
    In addition, the components or other application layers are listening for
    state changes. It's a typical implementation of <B>observable pattern</B>.
    If you're reading state with <B>useCounterStore</B> hook - you're
    automatically subscribed and the component will rerender after the state
    change.{" "}
  </M>
  <Code
    mode="dynamic"
    lang="tsx"
    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polubis/Snippets-for-articles-and-lessons/main/How%20to%20integrate%20state%20management%20in%20Zustand%20with%20NextJS/rerenders-when-components-state-change.tsx"
    linesCount={5}
  />
  <M>With that information, we may implement the following hook:</M>
  <Code
    mode="dynamic"
    lang="tsx"
    description="Implementation of useStoreSync hook"
    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polubis/Snippets-for-articles-and-lessons/main/How%20to%20integrate%20state%20management%20in%20Zustand%20with%20NextJS/use-server-store.ts"
    linesCount={25}
  />
  <M>And then we'll use our hook as follows: </M>
  <Code
    mode="dynamic"
    lang="tsx"
    added={[[3, 3]]}
    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polubis/Snippets-for-articles-and-lessons/main/How%20to%20integrate%20state%20management%20in%20Zustand%20with%20NextJS/counter-al-final.tsx"
    linesCount={7}
  />
  <M>
    Okay, so let's describe what happened. First, we are passing to the{" "}
    <B>useStoreSync</B> hook, the <B>useCounterStore</B> original hook and the{" "}
    <B>state from server</B>.{" "}
  </M>
  <Code
    mode="dynamic"
    lang="tsx"
    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polubis/Snippets-for-articles-and-lessons/main/How%20to%20integrate%20state%20management%20in%20Zustand%20with%20NextJS/06.tsx"
    linesCount={2}
  />
  <M>
    Next, we're checking about synchronization status. If a sync has not
    happened yet, we're setting the initial state as the state passed from the
    server, and then we're setting the flag to false. Thanks to this we'll avoid
    multiple state changes and not needed rerenders.
  </M>
  <Code
    mode="dynamic"
    lang="tsx"
    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polubis/Snippets-for-articles-and-lessons/main/How%20to%20integrate%20state%20management%20in%20Zustand%20with%20NextJS/07.tsx"
    linesCount={10}
  />
  <M>
    The most important part is to call it <B>at the first line</B> of{" "}
    <B>initial page</B> component and we need to do it <B>only once</B> per{" "}
    <B>store</B>.{" "}
  </M>
  <Code
    mode="dynamic"
    lang="tsx"

<Section>
  <XL>The showcase example</XL>
  <M>
    To show the result of integration we need some real-world examples instead
    of the <B>counter</B> one. Let's say we have two different views in which we
    want to display articles. The first one should fetch them only on the
    client, the second one should retrieve them on the server and sync up with
    our client state.
  </M>
  <M>This should look like this: </M>

  />
  <M>
    Take a look at the view behavior when changing url. On the first tab when we
    change URLs we have <B>Loading</B> message.
  </M>
  <M>
    In second tab, we display articles immediately (they are taken from the
    server) and synced up with the client as I mentioned before.{" "}
  </M>
</Section>

<Section>
  <XL>Integration with getStaticProps / getServerProps</XL>
  <M>
    Let's say we're using <B>getStaticProps</B> or <B>getServerProps</B> and we
    want to load the list of articles on the server. Then, we want to pass the
    list from the server and generate a page. The data loaded on the server must
    be synced with the client state. To achieve that we need the following
    code:{" "}
  </M>
  <Code
    mode="dynamic"
    lang="tsx"
    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polubis/Snippets-for-articles-and-lessons/main/How%20to%20integrate%20state%20management%20in%20Zustand%20with%20NextJS/09.tsx"
    linesCount={23}
  />
  <M>
    The same rule applies for <B>getServerProps</B>, just the function name will
    be different, so let's skip that.
  </M>
</Section>

<Section>
  <XL>Integration with server components/server actions</XL>
  <M>
    How to use it with <B>server components</B> in new <B>NextJS API</B>? We
    need a special, <B>client-side</B> only component that will use our hook and
    return <B>null</B>. Take a look at the following code and notice the usage
    of <B>use client</B> directive.
  </M>
  <Code
    mode="dynamic"
    lang="tsx"
    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polubis/Snippets-for-articles-and-lessons/main/How%20to%20integrate%20state%20management%20in%20Zustand%20with%20NextJS/16.tsx"
    linesCount={13}
  />
  <M>
    Now, let's use our component inside <B>ArticlesPage</B>:{" "}
  </M>
  <Code
    mode="dynamic"
    lang="tsx"
    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polubis/Snippets-for-articles-and-lessons/main/How%20to%20integrate%20state%20management%20in%20Zustand%20with%20NextJS/17.tsx"
    linesCount={27}
  />
  <M>
    Notice that we used the <B>SyncedWithArticles</B> component at the beginning
    of the <B>JSX</B> code - it triggers the sync procedure.

<Summary label="Summary and conclusions">
  <M>
    We integrated and synced up the state from the server with the client one. A
    small hook needs to be called at the beginning. Life is now much easier!
  </M>
  <M>
    What is really cool, the same solution will work for other <B>frameworks</B>{" "}
    like <B>Gatsby</B>.{" "}
  </M>
  <M>
    The most important part is that the implementation differs for "old" and
    "new" <B>NextJS</B>. With the previous <B>getStaticProps</B> and{" "}
    <B>getServerProps</B> we need just to call a hook at the beginning of the
    page.
  </M>
  <M>
    However, for <B>server components</B> and <B>server actions</B> we need a
    special wrapper component that will be used only on <B>client</B>.{" "}
