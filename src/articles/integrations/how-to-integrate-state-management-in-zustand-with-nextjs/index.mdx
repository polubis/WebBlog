<Prelude label="What we will achieve?">
  <M>
    The <B>NextJS</B> is a real game changer in the web ecosystem. However,
    integration with third-party libraries for state management like{" "}
    <B>Zustand</B> or <B>Redux</B> may be challenging. That's why today, we'll
    integrate <B>Next.js</B> app with <B>Zustand</B>, and at the end, you will
    know how to manage your state, keep it synced with a server.
  </M>
</Prelude>

<Section>
  <XL>Adding Zustand to NextJS project</XL>
  <M>
    Find some default <B>NextJS</B> project, I'll use this one:{" "}
    <A
      href="https://github.com/polubis/Dream-stack-for-React-dev/tree/article/How-to-integrate-state-management-in-Zustand-with-NextJS/system/apps/blog/store"

    </A>
    . You can create a dummy <B>NextJS</B> project via publicly available generators
    - it's not an important part of this article, so let's skip that. Just type in
    terminal: <B>npm i zustand --save</B> - lib will be added to <B>
      package.json
    </B>.
  </M>
  <M>
    Now, let's add the typical boilerplate code that is required to manage our
    state:{" "}
  </M>
  <Code
    mode="dynamic"
    lang="tsx"
    description="The problem with counter-value difference"
    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polubis/Snippets-for-articles-and-lessons/main/How%20to%20integrate%20state%20management%20in%20Zustand%20with%20NextJS/counter-sample.tsx"
    linesCount={36}
  />
  <M>
    In <B>console.log</B> statements we have different values for counter from
    the <B>server</B> and <B>client</B>. This is really bad and we need to solve
    this problem.
  </M>
</Section>

<Section>
  <XL>Syncing up the client/server state</XL>
  <M>
    We need to sync the state before the first render of any component. The{" "}
    <B>useCounterStore</B> created by <B>Zustand</B> exposes some static methods
    to change the state.
  </M>
  <Code
    mode="dynamic"
    lang="tsx"
    description="State change via static method"
    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polubis/Snippets-for-articles-and-lessons/main/How%20to%20integrate%20state%20management%20in%20Zustand%20with%20NextJS/static-change.tsx"
    linesCount={2}
  />
  <M>
    The state change done in <B>Zustand</B> happens immediately. It's not{" "}
    <B>async</B> operation, is just like changing a variable.{" "}
  </M>
  <M>
    However, the components or other application layers are listening for state
    changes. It's a typical implementation of <B>observable pattern</B>. If
    you're reading state with <B>useCounterStore</B> hook - you're automatically
    subscribed and the component will rerender after the state change.{" "}
  </M>
  <Code
    mode="dynamic"
    lang="tsx"
    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polubis/Snippets-for-articles-and-lessons/main/How%20to%20integrate%20state%20management%20in%20Zustand%20with%20NextJS/rerenders-when-components-state-change.tsx"
    linesCount={5}
  />
  <M>
    So, state reading is aka <B>"lazy"</B>. It's not immediate, but setting the
    state is. That's important information. To sync the state between
    server/client we just need to update the client state{" "}
    <B>before the first render happens</B>.
  </M>
  <M>
    Let's add logic to sync up the state! We need a custom hook to handle this.{" "}
  </M>
  <Code
    mode="dynamic"
    lang="tsx"
    description="Implementing useStoreSync hook"
    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polubis/Snippets-for-articles-and-lessons/main/How%20to%20integrate%20state%20management%20in%20Zustand%20with%20NextJS/use-server-store.ts"
    linesCount={26}
  />
  <M>And then we'll use our hook as follows: </M>
  <Code
    mode="dynamic"
    lang="tsx"
    added={[[3, 3]]}
    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polubis/Snippets-for-articles-and-lessons/main/How%20to%20integrate%20state%20management%20in%20Zustand%20with%20NextJS/counter-al-final.tsx"
    linesCount={7}
  />
  <M>
    Wow, and that's all? Yup! Okay, so let's describe what happened here step by
    step. First, we are passing to our <B>useStoreSync</B> hook the original
    client hook and the initial state returned by the server.{" "}
  </M>
  <Code
    mode="dynamic"
    lang="tsx"
    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polubis/Snippets-for-articles-and-lessons/main/How%20to%20integrate%20state%20management%20in%20Zustand%20with%20NextJS/06.tsx"
    linesCount={2}
  />
  <M>
    Next, we're checking about synchronization status. If a sync has not
    happened yet, we're setting the initial state to the state passed from the
    server, and then we're setting the flag to false - to avoid multiple state
    changes and not needed rerenders.{" "}
  </M>
  <Code
    mode="dynamic"
    lang="tsx"
    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polubis/Snippets-for-articles-and-lessons/main/How%20to%20integrate%20state%20management%20in%20Zustand%20with%20NextJS/07.tsx"
    linesCount={10}
  />
  <M>
    Then we're checking the environment in which the code is executed. If it's a
    server, we're creating a dummy initial hook and we're returning it. If it's
    a client, we're returning the original hook.{" "}
  </M>
  <Code
    mode="dynamic"
    lang="tsx"
    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polubis/Snippets-for-articles-and-lessons/main/How%20to%20integrate%20state%20management%20in%20Zustand%20with%20NextJS/08.tsx"
    linesCount={7}
  />
  <M>
    So, we have a generic mechanism to sync our server/client side state without
    additional rerenders.
  </M>
  <M>
    The most important part is to call it <B>at the first line</B> of your{" "}
    <B>initial page</B> component and you need to do it <B>only once</B> per{" "}
    <B>the store</B>.{" "}
  </M>
  <Code
    mode="dynamic"
    lang="tsx"
    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polubis/Snippets-for-articles-and-lessons/main/How%20to%20integrate%20state%20management%20in%20Zustand%20with%20NextJS/11.tsx"

  <XL>Exploring real-world use cases</XL>
  <M>
    Let's say we're using <B>getStaticProps</B> or <B>getServerProps</B> and we
    want to load the list of articles on the server. Then, we want to pass the
    list from the server and generate a page. The state loaded in the server
    must be synced with the client state. To achieve that we need the following
    code:{" "}
  </M>
  <Code
    mode="dynamic"
    lang="tsx"
    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polubis/Snippets-for-articles-and-lessons/main/How%20to%20integrate%20state%20management%20in%20Zustand%20with%20NextJS/09.tsx"
    linesCount={23}
  />
  <M>
    The same rule applies for <B>getServerProps</B>, just the function name will
    be different, so let's skip that. How to use it with{" "}
    <B>server components</B> used in new <B>NextJS API</B>?
  </M>
  <Code
    mode="dynamic"
    lang="tsx"

<Example label="The final code">
  <M>Here you have the hook implementation: </M>

    examples, just check the following{" "}

    repository.

</Example>

<Summary label="Summary and conclusions">
  <M>
    We integrated and synced up the state from the server with the client one. A
    small hook needs to be called at the beginning. Life is now much easier!
  </M>
  <M>
    What is really cool, the same solution will work for other <B>frameworks</B>{" "}
    like <B>Gatsby</B>.{" "}
