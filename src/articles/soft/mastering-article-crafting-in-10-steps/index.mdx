<Prelude label="The primary objective of the article">
  <M>
    In the age of information overload, the ability to produce{" "}
    <B>high-quality</B> articles is a <B>valuable skill</B>. Whether you're a
    seasoned writer or just starting, creating engaging and informative content
    requires careful consideration of various elements.
  </M>
  <M>
    A great article is <B>well structured</B>, completed with an{" "}
    <B>engaging narrative</B> and an <B>enjoyable writing style</B>. While you
    don't necessarily need to be a real writer, adhering to general rules can
    significantly enhance your chances of success ( •̀ ω •́ )✧.
  </M>
  <M>
    That's why my focus has shifted towards crafting{" "}
    <B>well-articulated articles</B>, making it my primary goal, one that is
    both iterative and meticulously refined. I've devised a{" "}
    <B>straightforward algorithm</B>, a set of <B>simple steps</B>, to ensure
    that I can seamlessly follow it for every article and not overlook any
    crucial elements.{" "}
  </M>
  <M>
    Before we talk about <B>algorithm</B>, let's think about what many people
    like in articles. People say over and over that good ones are easy to
    understand and interesting. Now, let's see what they should have:{" "}
  </M>
  <L>
    <Li>Interesting topic</Li>
    <Li>Engaging content</Li>
    <Li>Clarity and coherence</Li>
    <Li>Readable format</Li>
    <Li>Correct grammar and spelling</Li>
    <Li>Visual appeal</Li>
    <Li>Call to action or takeaway</Li>
    <Li>Unique perspective or insight</Li>

    <Li>Simple language</Li>
    <Li>Focused to achieve goal</Li>
    <Li>Unique content</Li>
    <Li>Fast learning curve</Li>
  </L>
  <M>
    We've identified the criteria that we should use to measure good articles,
    let's dive into the <B>algorithm</B> I've developed. Using a real article as
    an example, I'll walk you through the step-by-step process.
  </M>
</Prelude>

<Section>
  <XL>1. The topic and audience</XL>
  <M>
    Talking about anything might feel confusing, right? To make your writing
    interesting, you need to choose a topic that's really popular. It's like
    finding the coolest toys to play with! One tool I use a lot is like a
    special treasure map, and it's called the{" "}
    <A href="https://ads.google.com/" outside>
      Google Keywords Planner
    </A>
    . It helps me find the best topics to write about!

    description="Google Keywords Planner"
  />
  <M>
    Imagine we found out that things related to <B>Zustand</B> and <B>Redux</B>{" "}
    are super interesting right now. The number of times people search for these
    things is between 1,000 and 10,000, and not many people are talking about
    it. That means it's a great topic for us to write about 🚀!
  </M>
  <M>
    Let's write an article about comparing them. We'll explore what makes each
    of them special and help others understand which one might be the best for
    them ✨!
  </M>
  <M>
    Alright, there's one more crucial aspect to consider - <B>the audience</B>.
    Understanding the specific group of people interested in delving into your
    article is essential. In our case, the audience is comprised of{" "}
    <B>frontend developers</B>, particularly <B>Junior devs</B>. This
    distinction matters because, when sharing the article on social platforms
    through dedicated groups, sending a beginner - focused article to a group of{" "}
    <B>Senior developers</B> might not be well-received.
  </M>
</Section>

<Section>
  <XL>2. Crafting title, description and keywords</XL>
  <M>
    The crucial step now is to create the <B>above mentioned</B> with <B>SEO</B>{" "}
    in mind. It should be engaging, captivating attention, and, in general, be
    of the right length. It's like making sure our content is not just
    informative but also attractive and fits perfectly ✍️.
  </M>
  <M>
    I've entered more <B>keywords</B> into the tool we talked about earlier.
    Now, let's come up with a <B>title</B> and <B>article description</B> that
    include these keywords and look visually appealing.
  </M>

  <M>
    To make things simpler, especially if creativity isn't your strong suit
    (like me), you can harness the power of <B>AI</B>. The <B>ChatGPT</B>, in
    particular, excels at this. It's like having a helpful creative assistant at
    your fingertips.

    It seems the last prompt is the winner. The <B>title</B> is awesome, I'll
    just trim it a bit. Also, I'll tweak the <B>description</B> to suit my needs
    better. It's like putting the final touch on a masterpiece.

  <XL>3. The goal, narration style and form</XL>
  <M>
    Clearly defining your <B>goal</B> is paramount in maintaining a focused and{" "}
    <B>purposeful narrative</B>. This ensures that every element of your writing
    revolves around a specific problem or topic you intend to address.
    Emphasizing the significance of this step cannot be overstated. Many writers
    encounter challenges when they include content that is tangential to the
    main subject, resulting in lengthy and less engaging articles.
  </M>
  <M>
    My primary objective is to craft an <B>exhaustive guide</B> on the chosen
    topic. In my context, a "complete guide" signifies a comprehensive article
    encompassing all essential information, accompanied by relevant examples,
    visuals, and other supplementary elements.{" "}
  </M>
  <M>
    To maintain a <B>clear trajectory</B> and ensure <B>coherence</B>, I find it
    crucial to articulate this goal in writing. This written guide becomes my
    compass, helping me stay focused and consistently adhere to the intended
    scope throughout the writing process.
  </M>
  <M>
    The goal: <B>Complete guide about Redux vs Zustand (all aspects)</B>
  </M>
  <M>
    As we delve into <B>narration</B> and <B>form</B>, consistency is vital. Opt
    for a style and stick with it to keep readers engaged. In my view, the best
    approach is a friendly tone, making readers feel like we're crafting this
    content together as buddies. This not only ensures clarity but also enhances
    the overall reading experience.
  </M>
  <M>
    The narration style:{" "}
    <B>First person, using pronouns like "we're" and "together"</B>

</Section>

<Section>
  <XL>4. The plan and structure</XL>
  <M>
    Prior to diving into writing, take a moment to outline the structure of your
    article. By doing so, you create a <B>roadmap</B> that guides you through
    the topics and aspects you intend to cover. This structured approach not
    only helps organize your thoughts but also ensures a comprehensive coverage
    of all relevant content.
  </M>

</Section>

<Section>
  <XL>5. Introduction and summary</XL>
  <M>
    I strongly recommend beginning with this step; it instills focus right from
    the start on the most critical aspect of your article - <B>the goal</B>.
    Define <B>the problem</B> to be addressed and articulate the{" "}
    <B>goal clearly</B>. This not only sets the tone for your writing but also
    ensures a purposeful and directed approach throughout your entire article.
    Let's start with intro:
  </M>
  <M>
    <B>Why separate state management?</B>
  </M>
  <M>
    "In today's dynamic world of <B>frontend development</B>, an ongoing debate
    surrounds the quest for 'the best' state management tool within the{" "}
    <B>React</B> ecosystem. This topic is not just hot but also intriguing,
    particularly for newcomers to the field. To shed light on the matter, I've
    taken the initiative to craft a comprehensive article - a thorough guide
    that compares all essential aspects. By the end, you'll not only gain
    insights into each tool but also receive my opinion on whether it's worth
    adopting a particular one or perhaps exploring other options."
  </M>
  <M>
    Now, let's dive into <B>summary</B>.
  </M>
  <M>
    <B>My choice and advice</B>
  </M>
  <M>
    "We've delved into a thorough comparison, and it appears that <B>Zustand</B>{" "}
    takes the lead by default in almost all aspects. Achieving the same results
    as with <B>Redux</B> requires less effort. However, it's just one slice of
    the cake. As demonstrated, there's a potential concern with <B>Zustand</B> -
    it's relatively new compared to <B>Redux</B>. This brings a hint of caution.
    If you're integrating it into your projects, I recommend adopting the use of{" "}
    <B>facades</B>, as mentioned earlier. This ensures a smoother transition in
    case a migration becomes necessary, minimizing the time investment."
  </M>
</Section>

<Section>
  <XL>6. Adding content</XL>
  <M>
    The core of the article begins now. Ensure that you incorporate{" "}
    <B>key terms</B> from the previously crafted <B>tags, title, description</B>
    . Stay laser-focused on the main heading topic and maintain proper{" "}
    <B>grammar</B> throughout. Feel free to utilize <B>ChatGPT</B> for grammar
    correction, especially if <B>English</B> is not your first language - just
    like mine 💔.

<Section>
  <XL>7. Adding great examples</XL>
  <M>
    The article should be anything but dull; it's essential to captivate your
    readers. To achieve this, incorporate engaging elements such as compelling
    examples, well-formatted content with <B>GIFs</B>, <B>videos</B>,{" "}
    <B>presentations</B>, and <B>code snippets</B>. Take a moment to explore the
    widget embedded below, featuring a presentation that excels at simplifying

<Section>
  <XL>8. Review and final touch</XL>
  <M>
    Releasing your article immediately after completion is the least advisable
    approach. Oversights such as <B>typos</B> and <B>domain mistakes</B> could
    easily slip through. Personally, I adopt a practice of stepping away from
    the article for a few days before returning to review it. This allows me to
    spot errors and make necessary improvements. Following this, I share the
    article with someone else for a fresh perspective. Only after these careful
    steps and subsequent enhancements is the article truly ready for{" "}
    <B>publication</B>
  </M>
</Section>

<Section>
  <XL>9. Campaign, measurement and socials</XL>
  <M>
    This is the most exciting part - measuring the success of your article (just
    kidding about counting haters). Once you've published it, ensure it's
    accessible via{" "}
    <A href="https://search.google.com/search-console/about" outside>
      Google Search Console
    </A>{" "}
    on the internet. Share attention-grabbing posts and introductions tailored
    to specific groups - remember the advice in the first heading about{" "}
    <B>understanding your audience</B>.

  <XL>10. Get user feedback and improve</XL>
  <M>
    At this point, you possess all the tools necessary for refining your
    article. If you aim to be a proficient content creator,{" "}
    <B>continuous improvement</B> is key. Leverage user voting systems, such as{" "}
    <B>likes</B> and <B>comments</B>, to identify areas that might be unclear in
    your article. Engage with these comments by providing additional
    clarifications and improvements. The same approach applies to <B>SEO</B> and
    tracking. Constantly monitor and adjust to optimize your content.
  </M>
  <Hint hasBg>
    An important aspect to note: be prepared for criticism and negative
    comments. In my opinion, they are valuable because they highlight issuess
    that arise after someone else reads your article, providing you with an
    opportunity to enhance your content creation skills.
