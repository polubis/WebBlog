  <XL>No repetition with selectors</XL>
  <M>
    Imagine you want to change a <B>property</B> inside <B>store</B>. If it's
    just 3 places it's not a big deal, but what if it's 20 or more? In the
    example below we changed one property from <B>user</B> to <B>user1</B>.
  </M>

  <M>
    Without selectors, we'll need to change 20 files. With them, it's only 1...
    It's important to know that we may use selectors in other application layers
    - not only components.{" "}

  <XL>Rerenders reduction with selectors</XL>
  <M>Let's say we have 3 components. The <B>Top</B>, <B>Between</B> and <B>Last</B>. That's how they will be rendered: </M>

<M>Now, we'll implement a <B>counter</B> feature in <B>Redux</B> and <B>Zustand</B>. The <B>Last</B> component will read the value from the store, the component <B>Between</B> will just render children and the <B>First</B> component will schedule a <B>interval</B>.

  <XL>Performing computations based on state change</XL>
  <M>
    Let's say we want to perform a computation in every <B>counter</B> property
    change. It will be a simple <B>Fibonacci</B> number. Firstly, we need a
    function to calculate this number.{" "}
  </M>
  <Code
    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polubis/Working-with-selectors-in-Zustand-and-Redux/main/snippets/14.ts"
    mode="dynamic"
    lang="ts"
    linesCount={13}
  />
  <M>
    Now, we need a new <B>selector</B>.
  </M>
  <Code
    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polubis/Working-with-selectors-in-Zustand-and-Redux/main/snippets/15.ts"
    mode="dynamic"
    lang="ts"
    linesCount={6}
  />
  <M>
    This code will work, but there is a problem. The <B>Fibonacci</B> function
    will be executed all the time when the <B>counter store</B> property
    changes. We need to apply here a <B>memoization</B> technique - aka{" "}
    <B>flyweight</B> pattern. We can achieve it in <B>Redux/Zustand</B> with the
    same library - <B>reselect</B>.
  </M>
  <Hint hasBg>
    <M>
      <B>Memoization</B> is an optimization technique that is used to improve
      the efficiency of algorithms which requires repetitive computations. It's
      just <B>caching</B>.{" "}
    </M>
  </Hint>
  <Hint hasBg>
    We can use the built-in <B>React useMemo</B> hook to achieve similar results
    or implement <B>flyweight</B> pattern with a simple <B>JavaScript</B>{" "}
    object. I prefer to use the library to avoid maintenance for such code in my
    codebase and move memoization outside of <B>React</B> ecosystem.
  </Hint>
  <Code
    description="Memoized selector in Redux"
    mode="dynamic"
    linesCount={13}

    linesCount={12}
    description="Memoized selector in Zustand"
    mode="dynamic"
    lang="ts"
  />
  <M>
    With these changes <B>Fibonacci</B> function will be executed only, when
    we pass arguments that are different. It's cool - the previous computation
    will be stored and returned from the <B>cache</B>. It's fancy especially
    when we'll open the same component again - the next ticks will run much
    faster because <B>computations are returned from the cache</B>.
  </M>
</Section>

<Section>
  <XL>Dynamic selectors</XL>
  <M>
    The <B>dynamic selector</B> is the one that makes our component{" "}
    <B>rerender</B>. Let's start with examples:
  </M>
  <Code
    mode="dynamic"
    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polubis/Working-with-selectors-in-Zustand-and-Redux/main/snippets/18.tsx"
    linesCount={19}
    rolled
    description="Dynamic selector in Redux"
    lang="tsx"

  <Code
    mode="dynamic"

    linesCount={27}
    rolled
    description="Dynamic selector in Zustand"
  />
  <M>
    So, adding <B>dynamic selector</B> to this code will perform additional{" "}
    <B>rerenders</B> if the property in a state that we're selecting will
    change.
  </M>
  <M>
    These selectors are the most used in <B>React</B> applications, but is there
    an alternative that will not cause a rerender? Yes!
  </M>
</Section>

<Section>
  <XL>Static selectors</XL>
  <M>
    Imagine a situation in which you're not using data from <B>store</B> in your{" "}
    <B>JSX</B> component code, but this data is required to perform some
    operations after the user clicks a button - redirection to different urls.
  </M>
  <Code
    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polubis/Working-with-selectors-in-Zustand-and-Redux/main/snippets/20.tsx"
    mode="dynamic"
    lang="tsx"
    linesCount={18}
  />
  <M>
    So, how we can achieve it without making a rerender? Let's create{" "}
    <B>static selectors</B> for <B>Redux</B> and <B>Zustand</B>. Firstly, the{" "}
    <B>Redux</B>.{" "}
  </M>
  <Code
    description="Static selector in Redux"
    mode="dynamic"

    linesCount={23}
    rolled
    lang="tsx"
  />
  <M>
    Now, it's time for <B>Zustand</B>.
  </M>
  <Code
    mode="dynamic"
    lang="tsx"
    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polubis/Working-with-selectors-in-Zustand-and-Redux/main/snippets/22.tsx"
    linesCount={20}
    rolled
    description="Static selector in Zustand"
  />
  <M>
    As you saw we avoided not needed rerenders and thanks to <B>static</B>{" "}
    selectors we just picked small slice of our state.

<Section>
  <XL>Little tweaks for better readability and naming - conventions</XL>
  <M>
    When I'm writing my applications I'm trying to prepare some conventions and
    then follow them in projects. It keeps my codebase consistent and allows me
    to back to IDE after a long break and still write code in a similar pattern.
    I'm putting these rules inside the repository and saving it in the <B>md</B>{" "}
    file. To be honest it can be any place - u2y.
  </M>
  <M>
    <B>Why I'm saying that?</B>
  </M>
  <M>
    Look at the following example with typical naming conventions that are used
    in <B>Redux</B> or <B>Zustand</B>.
  </M>
  <Code
    mode="dynamic"
    lang="ts"
    linesCount={3}
    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polubis/Working-with-selectors-in-Zustand-and-Redux/main/snippets/23.tsx"
  />
  <M>
    Selectors code quickly will start to be repetitive and will contain the same
    prefixes... Usually, we're using selectors <B>per feature</B> so I'm
    wrapping them with one object and then reusing them in many places. From my
    perspective, it looks much better and it's easier to read but this is just
    an opinion.{" "}
  </M>
  <M>So that's my proposal: </M>
  <Code
    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polubis/Working-with-selectors-in-Zustand-and-Redux/main/snippets/24.tsx"
    mode="dynamic"
    lang="tsx"
    linesCount={5}
  />
  <M>
    In addition, you may use the same approach for your <B>Redux/Zustand</B>{" "}
    actions. It's cool how it makes code modular and reduces repetitive prefixes
    before selectors and actions.{" "}
  </M>
  <Code
    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polubis/Working-with-selectors-in-Zustand-and-Redux/main/snippets/25.tsx"

<Summary label="Conclusions and thoughts">
  <M>
    We explored the <B>selectors</B> concept in <B>Redux/Zustand</B> and now you
    know how to create <B>dynamic</B> and <B>static</B> selectors.
  </M>
  <M>
    You learned that <B>selectors</B> are an excellent mechanism to reduce
    rendering impact in applications. They provide better readability, reduce
    the extraction of data logic from complex models, and allow us to refactor
    our state read logic faster.
  </M>
  <M>
    I'm <B>encapsulating</B> selectors in <B>objects</B> for better{" "}
    <B>readability</B> and to reduce weird names. Of course, you may have
    different opinion, but I like to structure my code in a consistent way (in
    presented approach we did that). You may have your own approach - just be
    consistent and that's all.{" "}
