<Prelude label="Choosing a library for state management in React">
  <M>
    This is a very problematic and complicated topic. For a long time, I
    maneuvered between the <B>Redux toolkit</B> and <B>ContextAPI</B>. After a
    while, I always came to the same question - is there an alternative? There
    are many of them and if I had to list them, it would take me two days.
  </M>
  <M>
    I was looking for something straightforward - producing a small{" "}
    <B>boilerplate</B> and supporting a modular approach - because it keeps the
    application size small and easy to maintain. And I found it!
  </M>
  <M>
    Today we will compare the capabilities of <B>Zustand</B> and{" "}
    <B>Redux toolkit</B>.

  <XL>Setup for the Redux toolkit</XL>
  <M>
    To start with <B>Redux toolkit</B> and <B>React</B> we need to import
    created <B>store</B> and pass if through <B>Provider</B>.
  </M>
  <Code mode="static" lang="tsx">{`
import React from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'
import App from './App'
import { store } from './app/store'
import { Provider } from 'react-redux'
 
ReactDOM.render(
  // One "store", is forged to rule all components.
  <Provider store={store}>
    <App />
  </Provider>,
  document.getElementById('root')
)`}</Code>
  <M>
    Now it's time for a <B>slice</B> that will generate <B>reducers</B> and{" "}
    <B>actions</B> for us.
  </M>
  <Code mode="static" lang="ts">{`
import type { Post } from './models'
import { createSlice, type PayloadAction } from '@reduxjs/toolkit'
 
interface PostsState {
  loading: boolean;
  posts: Post[];
  error: string;
}
    
const postsSlice = createSlice({
  name: 'posts',
  initialState: <PostsState>{
    loading: false,
    posts: [],
    error: ""
  },
  reducers: {
    addPost(state, action: PayloadAction<Post>) {
      state.posts.push(action.payload)
    }
  },
})
 
export default postsSlice 
`}</Code>
  <M>
    {" "}
    Finally, all <B>reducers</B> must be merged into one - <B>reducers.ts</B> file.
  </M>
  <Code mode="static" lang="ts">{`
  import { combineReducers } from "redux"
 
import postsSlice from "./posts/postsSlice"
// In the future, the list of imports will grow significantly.
 
export default combineReducers({
  posts: postsSlice.reducer,
  // It will also grow...
})
`}</Code>
  <M>
    And we still need the <B>store.ts</B> file in which we will connect
    everything.
  </M>
  <Code
    mode="static"
    lang="ts"
  >{`import { configureStore } from '@reduxjs/toolkit'
import { useDispatch, useSelector, type TypedUseSelectorHook } from 'react-redux'
import reducer from './reducers'
import thunk from 'redux-thunk'
 
export const store = configureStore({
  reducer,
  middleware: [thunk]
})
 
// Types for our store.
export type RootState = ReturnType<typeof store.getState>
export type AppDispatch = typeof store.dispatch
 
// Hooks for reading data and triggering changes.
export const useAppDispatch: () => AppDispatch = useDispatch
export const useAppSelector: TypedUseSelectorHook<AppState> = useSelector
`}</Code>
  <M>Now the code in the component.</M>

import { addPost } from "actions/posts"
 
const AnyComponent = () => {
  const { posts, loading, error } = useAppSelector(({ posts }) => posts)
  const dispatch = useAppDispatch()
}
`}</Code>
  <M>
    I don't know about <B>you</B>, but I see a lot of code that will get even
    more complicated with each new feature.
  </M>
</Section>

<Section>
  <XL>Setup for Zustand</XL>
  <M>
    We need a <B>store</B>. That's all! It will have both a <B>state</B> and an{" "}
    <B>actions</B>. Note that <B>usePostsStore</B> is a hook!
  </M>
  <Code mode="static" lang="ts">{`import { create } from 'zustand'
import type { Post } from 'models/posts'
 
interface PostsStore {
  loading: boolean

  addPost: (post) => {
    set((state) => ({ posts: [state.posts, post] }))

export { usePostsStore }
`}</Code>
  <M>
    Now just import the <B>hook</B> created by <B>Zustand</B> to any component
    and use the state or action.
  </M>
  <Code mode="static" lang="tsx">{`import { usePostsStore } from 'store/posts'
 
const AnyComponent = () => {
  const { loading, posts, error, addPost } = usePostsStore()

  <Hint hasBg>
    <B>Zustand</B> is a library that does not have any additional dependencies

<Section>
  <XL>Boilerplate and application size</XL>
  <M>
    The size of the libraries is one thing, but the impact on the application
    size of the code we have to write in them is also important. For the
    implementation of the functionality with posts (see above), the application
    sizes (for the production configuration) are:
  </M>
  <M>
    <B>Redux</B> = <B>126kB</B> (pure project + feature posts).
  </M>
  <M>
    <B>Zustand</B> = <B>117KB</B> (pure project + feature posts).
  </M>
  <M>Now 30 functionalities with identical implementation.</M>
  <M>
    <B>Redux</B> = <B>30</B> (number of features) * <B>0.97kB </B> (boilerplate
    size per feature) = <B>29,1kB</B>.
  </M>
  <M>
    <B>Zustand</B> = <B>30</B> (number of features) * <B>0.44kB</B> (boilerplate
    size per feature) = <B>13.2kB</B>.
  </M>
  <M>So finally:</M>
  <M>
    <B>Redux</B> = <B>126kB</B> (initial size) + <B>29,1kB</B> (functional size
    30) = <B>155,1kB</B>.
  </M>
  <M>
    <B>Zustand</B> = <B>117KB </B> (initial size) + <B>13.2kB</B> (functional
    size 30) = <B>130,2kB</B>.
  </M>
  <M>
    Temporarily for <B>slow 3G</B>:{" "}
  </M>
  <M>
    <B>Redux</B> = <B>~3 456ms</B>

    <B>Zustand</B> = <B>~2 795ms</B>

<Section>
  <XL>Asynchronous operations in the Redux toolkit</XL>
  <M>
    {" "}
    If we use <B>redux-thunk</B>, we handle asynchronous operations in the <B>

`}</Code>
  <M>
    Now in our <B>slice</B>, we can handle state changes. The{" "}
    <B>Redux toolkit</B> will automatically generate the appropriate actions -{" "}
    <B>pending</B>, <B>fulfilled</B> and <B>rejected</B>, in which we must
    define how to change the state.

  <Code mode="static" lang="ts">{`import { createSlice } from "@reduxjs/toolkit"

  <M>
    It is worth noting that the state change is separated from the API call

  <XL>Type safety in the Redux toolkit</XL>

  <XL>Memoization and selectors in the Redux toolkit</XL>

    <B>Selectors</B> are functions that are designed to check whether a value or
    reference for a given fragment of the <B>store</B> has really changed. Then
    we can return this value or perform additional operations - mapping to
    another data format. The result of selectors can be <B>remembered</B> for
    specific arguments. If they have not changed, the old value will be returned
    - thanks to this, <B>React</B> will not re-render.

    To listen for state changes in both the <B>Redux toolkit</B> and <B>

  </M>
  <Code mode="static" lang="ts">{`

store.subscribe(() => {

useSomeStore.subscribe(() => {

    You can't see the difference in the API, but there is a dramatic difference

    any state change is triggered, while <B>Zustand</B> will call only when this
    one particular <B>store</B> changes.
  </M>
  <M>
    Similarly for <B>getState</B>. <B>Redux</B> will return everything (all

  <XL>Code splitting and lazy loading in the Redux toolkit</XL>

    point of loading code for admin functionality if the user is not an admin?
  </M>
  <M>
    In the <B>Redux toolkit</B>, at the very beginning, we must have a mechanism
    to replace the main <B>reducer</B> - we already have it in the library.
  </M>
  <Code mode="static" lang="ts">{`
// New reducer.
const newRootReducer = combineReducers({
  existingSlice: existingSliceReducer,
  newSlice: newSliceReducer,
});
// We replace it with the current one.
store.replaceReducer(newRootReducer);
`}</Code>
  <M>
    Now we need to be able to add a new <B>slice</B>.
  </M>
  <Code mode="static" lang="ts">{`
import { createStore } from 'redux';
 
// These are the reducers that must be 
// at the application initial load.
// They are required for it to work.
const staticReducers = {
  users: usersReducer,
  posts: postsReducer,
};
 
export default function configureStore(initialState) {
  const store = createStore(createReducer(), initialState);
 
  // Dictionary to hold dynamically added reducers.
  store.asyncReducers = {};
 
  // We add a new reducer and merge it with the existing ones.
  store.injectReducer = (key, asyncReducer) => {

function createReducer(asyncReducers) {
  return combineReducers({
    ...staticReducers,
    ...asyncReducers,

  <M>Now we can call it anywhere:</M>
  <Code mode="static" lang="ts">{`

    new possibilities - more than one <B>store</B>.
  </M>
  <M>
    <B>Zustand</B> also abandons the concept of <B>CQRS</B> (command query
    responsibility segregation), in which data reading is separated from the way
    of invoking changes on them - which significantly reduces <B>coupling</B>{" "}
    and potential refactors will be simpler, as well as code maintenance - at
    least in theory.

  <M>
    In practice though, the complexity of <B>Redux</B> results in total noodles,
