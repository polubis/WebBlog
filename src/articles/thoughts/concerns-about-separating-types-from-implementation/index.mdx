title: Concerns about separating types from implementation

<Prelude label="The topic introduction">
  <M>
    I've seen a lot of different opinions about splitting out the{" "}
    <B>type definitions</B> from <B>run time</B> code (our application{" "}
    <B>JavaScript</B> code). A lot of people prefer to have <B>types</B> in the
    same file - just before the implementation.{" "}
  </M>
  <Code
    mode="static"
    lang="ts"
  >{`// The type definition in same file with implementation: "sum.ts".
type Sum = (...args: number[]) => number
 
const sum: Sum = (...args) => {
  return args.reduce((acc, arg) => acc + arg, 0)
}`}</Code>
  <M>
    At the same time, other developers prefer to create files for <B>types</B>{" "}
    per each module.{" "}
  </M>
  <Code mode="static" lang="ts">{`// The code inside "defs.ts" file.
type Sum = (...args: number[]) => number

const sum: Sum = (...args) => {
  return args.reduce((acc, arg) => acc + arg, 0)

    I've my own thoughts about this topic and it's a good time to share them and
    summarize what I've learned during some research and after trying some stuff
    in code.{" "}

    Today we'll understand the <B>pros</B>/<B>cons</B> of splitting{" "}

  <XL>Good, old and universal rule - the separation of concerns</XL>
  <M>
    When you're creating a big feature you probably separate your codebase into
    distinct sections. The sections will be different based on the platform or
    technology that you working with. In languages like <B>C#</B>, it's common
    to separate <B>interfaces</B> (shape of the program/contract), to other
    files to achieve <B>reusability</B>, <B>modularity</B>,{" "}
    <B>maintainability</B>, and <B>easy-to-read/understand</B> codebase. This is
    a universal rule that can be applied to any <B>technology</B>.
  </M>
  <M>
    Let's take a look at an example in which we'll implement complex{" "}
    <B>button</B> component with motives, variants, and other stuff that are
    usually used in web apps.

import c from 'classnames';
 
const Button = ({ className, loading, ...props }: ButtonProps) => {
  const {

    size = 3,
    variant = 'filled',
    motive = 'primary',
  } = props;
 
  const classes = c(
    'button',
    'size-' + size,
    shape,

  <M>
    Now it's time for <B>type definitions</B> - at this moment we'll place them
    in a separate file.

  <M>
    We're humans, and still, we maintain the codebase (not AI 💔), so it's good
    to be able to work with code faster and in a more productive way. This
    simple example shows, how quickly simple component code can increase its
    number of lines and can start to be harder to read.

    Compare now what we had with this solution in which everything is added in a

  <XL>The circular dependency risk</XL>
  <M>
<B>Circular dependency</B> is a situation when module <B>A</B> will import something from module <B>B</B> and vice-versa. 
  </M>
  <Code description="This is a circular dependency" mode="static" lang="ts">{`// a.ts file.
import { b } from './b';
 
export const a = () => {
  console.log('A function')
}
 
// b.ts file
import { a } from './a';
 
export const b = () => {
  console.log('B function')
}`}</Code>
<M>Unfortunately, if you store the <B>type definitions</B> in the same file with implementation, you increase the risk of providing <B>circular dependency</B>, and with that you can increase a <B>application bundle size</B>, or you can provide really weird/hard to spot bugs.</M>
<M>The real-world example can be spotted in <B>Redux</B> setup boilerplate.</M>

<Code description="We mixed the type definitions with implementation" mode="static" lang="ts" >{`import rootReducer from "./reducers";
 
export type AppState = ReturnType<typeof rootReducer>;
 
const store = configureStore({
  reducer: rootReducer
});
 
export type AppStore = ReturnType<typeof setupStore>;
export type AppDispatch = AppStore["dispatch"];
 
export const useAppDispatch: () => AppDispatch = useDispatch;
export const useAppSelector: TypedUseSelectorHook<AppState> = useSelector;`}</Code>
<M>Firstly, it looks really weird (for me of course). Type declarations are <B>hoisted</B>, but anyway, it looks like we're using two different languages at the same time. It makes it harder to spot what is going on in this file.</M>
<M>Secondly, imagine that we want to create our custom <B>middleware</B> that listens for <B>dispatched actions</B>, and if it contains <B>pending</B> in <B>action type</B> we want to log the <B>payload</B> of an action. The <B>middleware</B> type from <B>redux</B> takes a type of <B>state</B> to be passed. </M>
<Code mode="static" lang="ts">{`
import type { AppState } from './store';
 
export const logPayload: Middleware<{}, AppState> =
  (store) => (next) => (action) => {
    if (action.type.includes('pending')) {
      const { type, ...payload } = action;
      console.log(payload);
    }
    
    return next(action)
};`}</Code>
<M>If we want to attach this middleware to our store, we need to import it and pass it to a <B>configureStore</B> function. </M>
<Code added={[[2,2], [8,9]]} description="Boom 💥, we have circular dependency" mode="static" lang="ts" >{`import rootReducer from "./reducers";
import { logPayload } from './logPayload';
 
export type AppState = ReturnType<typeof rootReducer>;
 
const store = configureStore({
  reducer: rootReducer,
  middleware: (getDefaultMiddleware) =>
    getDefaultMiddleware().concat(logPayload),
});
 
export type AppStore = ReturnType<typeof setupStore>;
export type AppDispatch = AppStore["dispatch"];
 
export const useAppDispatch: () => AppDispatch = useDispatch;
export const useAppSelector: TypedUseSelectorHook<AppState> = useSelector;`}</Code>
<M>As you saw creating circular dependency is really easy. We can avoid such a situation by storing <B>type definitions</B> in a separate file.</M>
<Code description="In defs.ts file" mode="static" lang="ts">{`
import rootReducer from "./reducers";
 
export type AppState = ReturnType<typeof rootReducer>;`}</Code>
<M>Now let's change in both places <B>import</B> statements.</M>
<Code mode="static" lang="ts" >{`import rootReducer from "./reducers";
import { logPayload } from './logPayload';
 
const store = configureStore({
  reducer: rootReducer,
  middleware: (getDefaultMiddleware) =>
    getDefaultMiddleware().concat(logPayload),
});`}</Code>
<M>Lastly, little change in the <B>middleware</B> file.</M>
<Code changed={[[1,1]]} mode="static" lang="ts">{`
import type { AppState } from './defs';
 
export const logPayload: Middleware<{}, AppState> =
  // Our code from previous example...
};`}</Code>
<M>So, as you saw storing <B>type defs</B> in separate files reduces the risk of having <B>circular dependency</B> between modules.</M>
<Hint hasBg>There are tools that allows us to track <B>circular dependencies</B>. One of them is the <B>nx</B>.

  <XL>The impact on performance</XL>
  <M>
    <B>Rebuild time 👍</B>
  </M>
  <M>
    When you modify a <B>TypeScript</B> file, the <B>TypeScript </B> compiler
    needs to recompile that file and any files that depend on it. If your type
    definitions are centralized in a single file and many other files depend on
    it, a change to that central file can trigger the recompilation of a large
    portion of your codebase.{" "}
  </M>
  <M>
    In contrast, if type definitions are separated into smaller, more focused
    files, changes to one type file are less likely to trigger unnecessary
    recompilations in unrelated parts of the codebase.
  </M>
  <M>
    <B>Parallelism</B> 👍
  </M>
  <M>
    When type definitions are in separate files, the build tool can parallelize
    the compilation of these files, potentially reducing the overall build time.
  </M>
  <M>
    <B>Initial build time</B> ❗
  </M>
  <M>
    If you have an excessive number of small type definition files, the initial
    load time for your development environment (e.g., in an IDE) might be longer
    because it needs to load and parse more files.
  </M>
  <M>
    <B>Note about performance</B>
  </M>
  <M>
    Before you start any changes in your codebase it's good to have consistent
    measurements of build times. You have tons of options, but I think the best
    one is just creating a small script that will create a file in each build
    (on <B>pull request</B>) with a snapshot of the time required to{" "}
    <B>build</B> dedicated application or <B>module</B>.{" "}

  <XL>Modeling aspect - types first approach</XL>
  <M>
    Before you start to work on any code, you should try to think about the
    shape of <B>API</B>, structure and dependencies. By splitting <B>types</B>{" "}
    from <B>implementation</B>, you are doing the modeling process -{" "}
    <B>types first approach</B>.
  </M>
  <M>
    Because of that your <B>API</B> will be more consistent and you'll be able
    to prepare multiple implementations. They will be independent, but still
    will have the same shape. Later, it's much easier to choose the best one or
    replace the other if it contains a bug/has dramatically bad performance.

    Simple split may increase code readability, especially if your{" "}

  <M>
    <B>Splitting types</B> into separate files may remove problems with{" "}

  </M>
  <M>
    We shouldn't do any premature optimizations - measure first and then try to
    improve build times (if it is a real problem!).

  <M>
