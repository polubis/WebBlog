title: Loops in JavaScript and their performance
---

<Prelude>
  <M>
    Long time ago I saw a <B>pull request</B> in which two developers were
    arguing about the loop performance. The argument turned into a long
    discussion. Everyone spammed links to threads on <B>Github</B> and articles
    to prove their point. Honestly, it was quite hilarious.
  </M>
  <M>
    This got me curious... I have never had time to check which of the available
    options is the best. The articles that covered this topic were superficial.
    Therefore, I decided to educate myself from the inside out. Let's discuss
    this in today's post.

  <XL>1. How to measure computational complexity in JavaScript?</XL>
  <M>
    It is impossible to say exactly how long it takes to call a particular
    function and more interestingly there will be different values for each
    measurement. At first glance it is very strange, but think about it.
    Processor does much more than running some dumb JavaScript program, and the
    browser does a lot more than running your code.
  </M>
  <M>
    Even though time measurement in JavaScript is inaccurate, we can still use a
    built-in API to measure it.

    I have proven to you that time varies. Now, we need to determine how we can
    figure out which loop is faster. We will use a technique that is called{" "}
    <B>sampling</B>. Instead of calling the function once and comparing it with
    the result of another program, we will run it a thousand/million times and
    calculate the total time.
  </M>
  <Hint hasBg>
    Run the given code on your computer and check how running programs affects
    the result of any ðŸ’» function.

  <XL>3. Displaying the results</XL>
  <M>
    At this stage we have clean data, but who wants to go through it manually.
    We need to sum the values and round them to four decimal places. If
    something lasts <B>0.00001532</B> seconds then - let's agree - the user is
    unlikely to notice it.

  <M>
    What do we have here? We called the sum function three times and passed to
    it six numbers from <B>1 to 6</B>. The total duration of these calculations
    was <B>0.0101</B> seconds.
  </M>
  <Hint hasBg>
    JS is weird. Run the code three times and see that the values are different.

<Section>
  <XL>4. Loops and recurrence</XL>
  <M>
    We need a several implementations of sum numbers function. Later we'll
    compare the result with a ready-made tool for checking optimization and we
    will draw conclusions.

  <M>
    I assume you were suprised by the absence of the <B>recursiveSum</B> call.
    It is intentional. Here a small spoiler - this implementation will have the
    worst result. Bad enough to cause a <B>stack overflow</B> ðŸ’¥.
  </M>
</Section>

<Section>
  <XL>5. Let's check the results</XL>
  <M>
    When there is little data (100-1000) then you can't see much difference. It
    even looks like the results are random (it takes such a short time that
    there is no difference which implementation we used). Everything changes
    when there is more data. Suddenly, it turns out that the <B>for</B> loop
    always appears in the first place, and the difference between the rest is
    significant.
  </M>
  <Img
    border

    description="Tests in our mini app"
  />
  <M>
    Why is this happening? Modern processors are very fast. If they are not
    overloaded then there isn't much difference among times. When increasing the
    set of numbers the processor begins to "tire" (or rather the browser).
    That's why we see differences.
  </M>
  <M>
    In addition, it is important to remember that JavaScript is transformed into
    intermediate language and then to machine code. The implementation that
    hides inside is unkown for programmers. It may be that the <B>for</B> loop
    has an advantage over <B>while</B> because the code "underneath" is
    optimized for it.
  </M>
  <M>
    One more point. Why then the methods built into prototype <B>Array</B> are
    slower if they use a <B>for</B> loop inside? This is due to the additional
    operations that we as developers agree to, gaining on the code clarity and
    losing on its speed (according to the principle of something for something).
    Used abstractions like <B>forEach</B> and <B>reduce</B> performs additional
    operations at each iteration, so this accounted for their inferior
    performance.

    (such an affliction of a front-end developer). I dropped the earlier
    examples and came up with exactly the same verdict. Loop <B>for</B> led the
    way with larger sets of numbers, and with smaller ones it was impossible to
    judge which is the best. I also checked the recursive function. Just as
    before, it stood off from the very beginning.

<Summary>
  <M>
    After this post you already know that measuring computational complexity can
    be "tricky." It turns out that it's hard to tell which loop is fastest.
  </M>
  <M>
    The syntax of language is important, but not as much as algorithm and skills
    of programmer on side of which stands answer to the question - which
    solution is faster?
  </M>
  <M>
    Remember that memory complexity is also important and sometimes even more
    important. I think we'll go through it another time.
