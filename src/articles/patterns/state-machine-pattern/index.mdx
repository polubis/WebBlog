title: State machine pattern
---

<Prelude>
  <M>
    Imagine an ancient coffee machine. You can control the stages of coffee
    preparation manually and decide when a dedicated step should be performed.
  </M>
  <M>
    Express can be destroyed if you press the button at the wrong moment. How do
    you know if now is the right time to grind coffee? It is much more
    convenient to have the software (state machine) which handles that.
  </M>
</Prelude>

<Section>
  <XL>1. State machine</XL>
  <M>
    The state machine is a mechanism that handles the correct order of steps in
    the process.
  </M>
  <M>
    In the image below you can see states inside rectangles and actions that are
    displayed above lines. These actions trigger a state change. They can have
    additional data like temperature which can be needed for other states to
    work.
  </M>

<Section>
  <XL>2. Implementation</XL>
  <M>
    In code, the state can be reflected via object. In our code, we use
    functions to create these objects. This reduces boilerplate and gives good
    type safety.
  </M>
  <M>
    Transitions from one state to another are implemented by using references to
    other functions in objects. If there will be an attempt to change state in
    invalid order - you will get an exception.
  </M>
  <Hint hasBg>
    Function declarations are hoisted. It means we don't need to worry about the
    correct order of declarations. This would not be possible with classes or
    function expressions.

<Section>
  <XL>3. Black box</XL>
  <M>
    Helper function reduces boilerplate and makes the whole state machine
    black-boxed. It reduces solution flexibility - you want this. After all, the
    coffee machine does not start with a state other than Idle.

<Section>
  <XL>4. Example of usage in React</XL>
  <M>
    If you want to use your state machine, it's a good idea to create a facade
    hook to expose consistent API / reuse it later in another view. You will
    have always a union of possible states because of the exhaustiveness
    checking mechanism from TypeScript.

<Section>
  <XL>5. You can make it generic</XL>
  <M>
    After several attempts, I think it's not worth it. That's because of the
    additional complexity which we adding. The decision is on your side.
  </M>
  <Hint hasBg>
    Instead of implementing it from scratch, you can use prod ready solution -
    xstate library which gives additional features and adds cool visualization.

<Summary>
  <M>
    After this short adventure, you probably understand what the state machine
    can do for you. Usage of this pattern dramatically improves your code base,
    especially in complex state management.
