title: Working with local storage vs session storage
---

<Prelude>
  <M>
    <B>Local storage</B> and <B>session storage</B> are the most commonly used
    mechanisms for storing data in web applications. I skip cookies üç™ because
    I'm allergic to gluten.
  </M>
  <M>
    Today we'll create a mechanism that will unify the work of these impostors,
    ensuring <B>type safety</B> and making reading and much manipulation
    simpler!
  </M>
</Prelude>

<Section>
  <XL>Why do we need a wrapper for local/session storage?</XL>
  <M>
    Analyzing the <B>local/session</B> storage API, you can see that their
    methods are identical - they have the same signature.
  </M>
  <Code mode="static" lang="ts">
    {`// "clear" clears all local storage.
localStorage.clear()
localStorage.removeItem('my-item')
// Allowed only "string" as a value.
localStorage.setItem('my-item', 'value')
// The returned value is always "string".
const lsValue = localStorage.getItem('my-item')
 
// "clear" clears all session storage.
sessionStorage.clear()
sessionStorage.removeItem('my-item')
// Allowed only "string" as a value.
sessionStorage.setItem('my-item', 'true')
// The returned value is always "string".
const sValue = sessionStorage.getItem('my-item')
`}
  </Code>
  <M>
    <B>What catches the eye at first glance?</B>
  </M>
  <L>
    <Li>The key is 'string'</Li>
    <Li>The received value is of type 'string'</Li>
    <Li>The APIs are identical</Li>
    <Li>No encapsulation</Li>
  </L>
  <M>It's easy to make a typo...</M>
  <Code
    mode="static"
    lang="ts"
  >{`const value = localStorage.getItem('ty,po')`}</Code>
  <M>
    In addition, we can by mistake run this code on the server side, which has
    no chance of working -{" "}
    <B>both APIs are only available in the browser environment</B>.
  </M>
  <Code mode="static" lang="ts">{`
// server.ts
// This is code that runs on the server side!
const value = localStorage.getItem('my-value')
// Get ready for an exception!
`}</Code>
  <M>
    The error message may not necessarily guide you to the cause of the error.
    This is a problem, especially for <B>beginners</B>.
  </M>
  <M>
    <B>What about reading and writing?</B>
  </M>
  <M>
    We must do repetitive logic every time - parsing when reading and writing.
  </M>
  <Code mode="static" lang="ts">
    {`
// @@@ Reading @@@
 
// It is a "string"! It needs to be converted to "object".
const user = localStorage.get('user')
console.log(user.id) // undefined! 
console.log(JSON.parse(user.id)) // 1
 
// @@@ Writting @@@
 
// This is an "object"! It needs to be converted to a "string".
// Type error - requires "string".
localStorage.setItem('user', user)
// Now it's ok!
localStorage.setItem('user', JSON.stringify(user))
`}
  </Code>
  <M>
    It's time for one last treat! What about mocking when testing? Well, we are
    facing the same duplication of logic and lack of strong typing.
  </M>
  <Code mode="static" lang="ts">
    {` describe('Authorization works when: ', () => {
  afterEach(() => {
    localStorage.clear()
  })
 
  it('gets user from storage', () => {
    const user = { id: 1 }
    // Again, we are repeating "stringify" and we 
    // are fragile to typo...
    localStorage.set('user', JSON.stringify(user))
 
    const result = getUserFromStorage()
 
    expect(result).toEqual(user)
  })
})
 `}
  </Code>
  <M>
    As you can see there is a lot of it, and I still left out such things as:
  </M>
  <L>
    <Li>What if we need an additional method?</Li>
    <Li>No encapsulation</Li>
    <Li>
      Singleton on the entire application - easy to mess up other functionality
    </Li>
    <Li>
      We can create a collision - overwrite a value set in another functionality
    </Li>
  </L>
  <M>We need to get it right!</M>
</Section>

<Section>
  <XL>A little inspiration to get started</XL>
  <M>
    Do you remember the <B>Axios</B> library? You probably do! In it, we create
    an instance of an object that, based on the passed configuration, returns
    you a specific, consistent and convenient to use API. We want to achieve the
    same result.
  </M>
  <M>
    At <B>Axios</B>, we do just that:
  </M>
  <Code mode="static" lang="ts">
    {`const blogAPI = axios.create({
  baseURL: getUrl(),
  withCredentials: true,
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  },
  validateStatus: isOkStatus,
})
 
// We have methods that may use the passed configuration.
blogAPI.post()
blogAPI.get()`}
  </Code>
  <M>Our small library will do just that:</M>
  <Code
    mode="static"
    lang="ts"
    description="This is how the initialization will look like"
  >{`
import { storage } from 'storage'
 
interface AuthStorage {
  authorized: boolean
}
 
// We can pass "local/session" as a value.
const authStorage = storage<AuthStorage>("session");
`}</Code>
  <M>Here are the methods calls:</M>
  <Code
    mode="static"
    lang="ts"
    description="This is how our methods will look like"
  >{`
// I will only clear what was set by the methods
// from "authStorage" and nothing more!
authStorage.clear()
 
// I will clear the "authorized" flag only.
authStorage.remove('authorized')
 
// We will download all the keys.
const keys = authStorage.getKeys()
console.log(keys) // ['authorized']
 
// We will get a boolean value, not "true".
// We no longer need to call "JSON.parse".
authStorage.get('authorized')
console.log(authorized) // true/false
 
// We will set the value of "authorized" to true.
// We don't need to use "JSON.stringify".
authStorage.set('authorized', true)`}</Code>
  <M>
    Take a look at the <B>gif</B> below and see what the target idea is:

  <XL>Let's model local/session storage and write tests</XL>
  <M>
    To begin with, let's create a <B>string literal</B> type in which we define
    the supported data sources and let's add a <B>storage</B> function skeleton.
  </M>
  <Code mode="static" lang="ts">
    {`
type StorageType = 'session' | 'local'
 
const storage = <T extends Record<string, any>>(
  type: StorageType = 'local'
) => {
 // Our code will be here!
}
`}
  </Code>
  <M>
    Now tests for an implementation that is not ready yet. The tests will be red
    until we write code to make them green - we will use <B>TDD</B>.

<XL>Time for implementation - we make our tests green</XL>
<M>Well, we have the models, the tests and we know how our API will look/work - now it's time for implementation which is what <B>FE devs</B> like us love the most.</M>
<M>We will start with a function that will throw an exception with an appropriate message if <B>local/session</B> storage is not defined in a global object - for example, we ran our function on the server side.</M>
<Code mode="static" lang="ts" added={[[1,17]]}>
{`
import type { StorageType } from './defs'
 
const getStorage = (type: StorageType): Storage => {
  const storage = type === 'local' ? localStorage : sessionStorage;
  
  if (!storage) {
    throw Error(\`
        Cannot find local storage and session storage.
  
        It may be caused because: 
            - both are unsupported,
            - you're using this util on a server (during SSR or SSG).
    \`);
  }
  
  return storage
}
 
const storage = <T extends Record<string, any>>(
  type: StorageType = 'local'
) => {
// There is still nothing here!
}`}
</Code>
<M>Next, we will add a method implementation for reading a single value: <B>get</B>. Note the casting that is necessary - the <B>JSON.parse</B> method does not allow you to pass a generic parameter.</M>
<Code mode="static" lang="ts" added={[[6,19], [22,22]]}>{`
// "T extends Record<string, any>" guarantees that the 
// passed generic type must be an object.
const storage = <T extends Record<string, any>>(
  type: StorageType = 'local'
) => {
  // Here we will store the added keys.
  let keys: (keyof T)[] = []; 
  
  const get = <K extends keyof T>(key: K): T[K] | null => {
    // We retrieve the value from "storage", an exception will be thrown if the
    // we call "get" on the server side.
    const value = getStorage(type).getItem(key.toString())
 
    if (value === null) {
      return null
    }
 
    return JSON.parse(value) as T[K]
  }
 
  return {
    get,
  }
}
`}</Code>
<M>It's time for <B>getAll</B>, which is designed to return all values set. Note the <B>Record</B> and its "strange" typing. We want the returned object to have the same keys as the passed interface and the corresponding values.</M>
<Code mode="static" lang="ts" added={[[1,17], [21,21]]}>
{`  
// The returned object must have the key of the passed
// generic type and a value under that key.
const getAll = (): Record<keyof T, T[keyof T] | null> => {
  const allStorageItems = keys.reduce<T>((acc, key) => {
    // We are using the previously implemented "get" function.
    const value = get(key)
 
    if (value === null) return acc
    // We are creating an object.
    return {
      ...acc,
      [key]: value,
    };
  }, {} as T)
 
  return allStorageItems
};
 
return {
  get,
  getAll
}
`}
</Code>

<M>
  At this point, we have two tests that are green. This means that throwing
  exceptions and reading a single value and multiple values is working properly.
</M>

<L>
  <Li>throws an error if any storage is undefined ‚úîÔ∏è</Li>
  <Li>allows to get all values ‚úîÔ∏è</Li>
</L>

<M>
  Now it's time to <B>getKeys</B>. Here there is no surprise. We simply return
  the <B>keys</B>, which we can access thanks to <B>closure</B>.
</M>

<Code
  mode="static"
  lang="ts"
  added={[
    [1, 3],
    [8, 8],
  ]}
>
  {`  const getKeys = (): (keyof T)[] => {
  return keys;
};
   
return {
  get,
  getAll,
  getKeys 
}`}
</Code>

<M>
  Why is it a function and not simply <B>keys: keys</B>. It must be a function
  that reads the "latest" values. If it was a variable - the value would be
  always the same - initially adjusted keys (empty array).
</M>

<M>After this change, the next test becomes green.</M>

<L>
  <Li>picks keys from local storage or session storage ‚úîÔ∏è</Li>
</L>

<M>
  Now it's time for the last four methods: <B>remove</B>, <B>set</B>,{" "}
  <B>patch</B> and <B>clear</B>.
</M>

<Code
  mode="static"
  lang="ts"
  added={[
    [1, 4],
    [6, 9],
    [11, 13],
    [15, 19],
    [23, 26],
  ]}
>
  {`const remove = <K extends keyof T>(key: K): void => {
  getStorage(type).removeItem(key.toString())
  keys = keys.filter((currKey) => currKey !== key)
};
 
const set = <K extends keyof T>(key: K, value: T[K]): void => {
  getStorage(type).setItem(key as string, JSON.stringify(value))
  !keys.includes(key) && keys.push(key)
}
 
const clear = (): void => {
  keys.forEach(remove)
}
 
const patch = (obj: Partial<T>): void => {
  Object.entries(obj).forEach(([key, value]) => {
    if (value !== undefined) set(key, value)
  })
}
 
return {
  getKeys,
  remove,
  set,
  patch,
  clear,
}
`}
</Code>

<M>In <B>remove</B>, we remove the value from the selected <B>local/session</B> storage, and then we get rid of the passed key from the array.</M>
<M>In <B>set</B>, we set the value and add the key. At the same time, we check if the key already exists. If it does, we do not add the same - why do we need duplicates?</M>
<M>In <B>clear</B>, we clean everything that has ever been set - not all local/session storage - this could negatively affect other functionality.</M>
<M>In the <B>patch</B>, we add as many values as we passed keys to the object. At the same time, we check if the passed value is by any chance <B>undefined</B> - this will cause an exception in <B>JSON.parse</B> when trying to read it, so we're skipping these values.</M>
<M>After all these code changes, our tests are as green as <B>Shrek</B>.</M>

<Summary>
  <M>Once again at ease with what we have achieved üßÇ:</M>
  <L>
    <Li>We have developer-friendly exceptions</Li>
    <Li>Local/session storage management is modular</Li>
    <Li>We have type-safety and typo protection</Li>
    <Li>No need to store keys in variables</Li>
    <Li>We can easily add new methods and extend the solution</Li>
    <Li>The solution can be used to mock up values in tests as well</Li>
    <Li>Consistent API</Li>
    <Li>Less risk of collisions or overwriting values in other features</Li>
  </L>
  <M>
    It is worth mentioning that introducing an abstraction such as so does not
    always make sense. In this case, it is useful, but it is worth conducting a
    comparison after the work is completed what is the profit and the result.
    Maybe it was not needed?
  </M>
  <M>In my opinion, it is not essential, but it makes life easier.</M>
</Summary>
