description: Let's see how you can save time by using the porting technique when migrating from one technology to another.

title: Porting for React applications
---

<Prelude>
  <M>
    The world of the frontend is saturated with buzzwords. To avoid problems
    with migration into other technologies, it's worth to use <B>porting</B>{" "}
    technique in your code. Let's check it together in this article.
  </M>
</Prelude>

<Section>
  <XL>Understanding problem</XL>
  <M>
    Let's assume that you wrote the platform and it took two years. You used{" "}
    <B>Gatsby</B> and <B>Netlify </B> in particular. One day you see a{" "}
    <B>YouTube</B> video that says your technology stack is dead. Thumbnail of
    this video looks more or less like this one:{" "}
  </M>
  <Img
    src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/c2XqFcOrXs0/maxresdefault.jpg"
    description="GIGA_CRINGE"
  />
  <M>
    The video is controversial, does not give real examples and ignores many
    aspects.{" "}
  </M>
  <M>
    One day you have a flooded wall on <B>LinkedIn</B> and it turns out that
    over time the technology will no longer be supported (or there is such a
    risk).
  </M>
  <M>
    It's not your fault, but you have to migrate to <B>Next</B> and{" "}
    <B>Vercel</B>. The first problem arises. Your code is so strongly tied to
    the <B>Gatsby</B> ecosystem that moving it will not be trivial and will take
    a lot of time. How we can deal with such risks?
  </M>
  <Hint hasBg>
    It is very important to not trust every influencer. Many of them create
    panic and decrease or multiply certain problems and all just for the sake of
    views.
  </Hint>
</Section>

<Section>
  <XL>Code coupled with the framework</XL>
  <M>
    In <B>Gatsby</B> for the files based on which the framework generates{" "}
    <B>static pages</B>, we usually have some kind of <B>GraphQL</B> query and{" "}
    <B>JSX</B> code.
  </M>
  <Snippet>{`
// --- OurPage.tsx file ---
const query = graphql\`
    images: allFile(filter: { name: { regex: "/image/" } }) {
        src
        name
    }
\`
 
interface Image {
    src: string;
    name: string;
}
 
interface OurPageProps {
    pageContext: {
    images: Image[]
};
  
// We're using previous GraphQL query üîù.
// Gatsby automatically injects response as props to OurPage component.
const OurPage = ({ pageContext: { images } }: OurPageProps) => {
    return <div>{images.length}</div>
}
`}</Snippet>
  <M>
    It is an request like any other. What if the technology we migrate to does
    not have <B>GraphQL</B> but <B>something else</B>? The data will have the
    same shape, but the form of the query will be completely different... It may
    be a <B>HTTP</B> request for example.
  </M>
  <M>
    This shows how our code for generating the page has been tied to a
    particular technology. If you would like to display the page in <B>Next</B>,
    copying this file is not enough - major changes are needed.
  </M>
</Section>
<Section>
  <XL>Detaching from Gatsby</XL>
  <M>
    We have to use a pattern called <B>facade</B>. The pattern involves wrapping
    an implementation of another module (most often a library), in order to
    avoid using it directly in code.
  </M>
  <M>
    Thanks to this, the replacement of the library will get around without any
    problem. Take a look at the following example:
  </M>
  <Snippet description="New file has been created">
    {`
// --- OurPageView.tsx ---
 
// Now all domain interfaces are inside models.ts file. 
// We're using alias "@models" to import them.
import type { Image } from "@models"
 
interface OurPageViewProps {
    images: Image[]
}
 
const OurPageView = ({ images }: OurPageViewProps) => {
    return <div>{images.length}</div>
}
 
export { OurPageView, type OurPageViewProps }
`}
  </Snippet>
  <M>
    Note the absence of any reference to <B>Gatsby</B>. There are no queries.
    This component can be used also in <B>Next</B>, pure <B>SPA React</B> and
    others.
  </M>
  <M>Now we need to apply changes in our page file.</M>
  <Snippet description="Small refactor added">
    {`
// --- OurPage.tsx file ---
 
import type { Image } from '@models'
import { OurPageView } from '@views'
 
const query = graphql\`
  images: allFile(filter: { name: { regex: "/image/" } }) {
      src
      name
  }
\`
 
interface OurPageProps {
    pageContext: {
        images: Image[]
    };
}
 
// Now all the functionality requires
// only the data and it will already work.
const OurPage = ({ pageContext: { images } }: OurPageProps) => {
    return <OurPageView images={images} />
}
`}
  </Snippet>
  <M>
    By implementing such an approach we reduce the coupling of the business
    sphere of the application with a particular technology.
  </M>
  <M>
    It's like writing <B>SQL</B> queries manually in the controller, and later
    when migrating to <B>MongoDB</B> - you lament that you have 300 files to
    change, instead of just one.
  </M>

  <XL>Usage in Next and Gatsby</XL>
  <M>
    As I promised so I will show. See that now we have the opportunity to use
    the same code in two differently working frameworks.
  </M>
  <M>
    {" "}
    Firstly, we'll use it in <B>Next.js</B>:
  </M>
  <Snippet>
    {`
interface OurPageProps {
    images: Image[]
}
// In Next.js we're using different images load strategy. We are loading images from API.
export const getStaticProps: GetStaticProps<OurPageProps > = async ({
    params,
}: ArticlePageParams) => {
    const images = await getImages();
 
    return {
        props: {
            images
        }
    };
};
 
const OurPage = (props: OurPageProps) => {
    return (
        <OurPageView images={images} />
    ); 
}; `}
  </Snippet>
  <M>
    Secondly, we'll use it in <B>Gatsby</B>:
  </M>
  <Snippet>
    {`
import type { Image } from '@models'
import { OurPageView } from '@views'
 
const query = graphql\`
    images: allFile(filter: { name: { regex: "/image/" } }) {
        src
        name
    }
\`
 
interface OurPageProps {
    pageContext: {
        images: Image[]
    };
}
 
const OurPage = ({ pageContext: { images } }: OurPageProps) => {
    return <OurPageView images={images} />
}
`}
  </Snippet>

  <XL>Keep a healthy mind</XL>
  <M>
    You may feel the need to write facades for any library - if you've
    encountered this for the first time, I'll tell you right away that it's
    natural and you don't need to go to a psychologistüç∑.
  </M>
  <M>It is worth applying this pattern in the following cases:</M>
  <List items="When the future of technology is uncertain,When the library API is inconvenient and you want to rework it slightly,When the library you use is 100% temporary (MVP for example)" />
  <M>
    It is also worth mentioning that the implementation of this pattern is an
    extra minute of work. With a snippet in the code a few seconds, and then it
    saves tons of money and time.
  </M>
</Section>
<Summary>
  <M>
    Would you rather migrate from <B>Gatsby </B> to <B>Next</B> in an hour? Or
    would you prefer a few days?
  </M>
  <M>
    The choice is yours, and the truth is that the porting technique makes a
    difference. Of course, everything is calculation of profits and losses.
