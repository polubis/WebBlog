  <M>
    I recall my time working for a company with a distinctive brand identity.
    During this tenure, a consistent look and feel were essential across all our
    applications, as emphasized by our project manager. The challenge we faced
    was the presence of significant duplication in presentation code across our
    four applications, primarily because individual teams had developed them
    separately.
  </M>
  <M>
    In light of this, the company was gearing up to create additional
    applications, prompting the pressing question:{" "}
  </M>
  <M>
    <B>
      "How do we efficiently reuse this duplicated code while maintaining a
      uniform appearance across distinct applications?"
    </B>
  </M>
  <M>
    The solution lies in the establishment of a <B>components library</B>, a
    task that can prove to be quite formidable. This is because numerous factors
    must be carefully considered during the implementation of such a library.
    Questions arise, such as where to store it, what stack is most suitable, and
    what should serve as the definitive source for documenting these components,
    among a multitude of other critical considerations.
  </M>
  <M>
    This is precisely why I've crafted this article. I aim to guide you through
    the process of effectively <B>documenting</B> your design system, provide
    insights into <B>where to store it</B>, offer advice on selecting the{" "}
    <B>right tech stack</B>, and walk you through the steps of constructing a
    components library, all with the intent of making this topic more accessible
    and comprehensible to you.

  <XL>What is a design system?</XL>
  <M>
    A <B>design system</B> is a group of rules, restrictions, color palettes,
    spacings, and general workflow rules when designing/building a UI.
  </M>
  <M>
    Why are these rules necessary, you may wonder? The answer is
    straightforward:{" "}
  </M>
  <M>
    <B>
      "They are vital for maintaining a consistent and cohesive user interface
      across a multitude of solutions."
    </B>
  </M>
  <M>
    The <B>development of every component library</B> should have its foundation
    in a robust design system. Without it, you risk ending up with a disorderly,
    unattractive, and visually unreliable presentation layer.
  </M>
  <M>
    Before you embark on coding, it's essential to establish the framework of
    your design system. This foundational structure can be housed within tools
    like <B>Figma</B> or <B>AdobeXD</B>. For particularly intricate design
    systems, you might consider supplementing your documentation with platforms
    such as <B>Confluence</B> or other suitable alternatives.
  </M>
  <M>Here you have the most popular design systems that are well described: </M>

  <XL>Exploring design system tokens</XL>
  <M>
    When I discussed the <B>design system</B>, I introduced the concept of
    individual decisions that designers make to ensure a consistent look and
    feel. These decisions are referred to as <B>design tokens</B>.
  </M>
  <M>
    They encompass a wide range of elements, such as an available color palette,
    spacing values (e.g., 4px, 8px, and so on), font variations, and numerous
    other constants that will be consistently applied to every component.
  </M>
  <M>
    Now, take a moment to examine the <B>GIF</B> provided below. Within it,
    you'll find a multitude of design tokens that play a pivotal role in
    defining our visual identity and aesthetic.
  </M>

<Section>
  <XL>Mapping design tokens to code</XL>
  <M>
    Now, it's time to map the <B>designer's decisions</B> into code. Here, I'll
    provide you with examples of how this process is carried out in both the{" "}
    <B>Tailwind</B> and <B>Material UI</B> libraries.
  </M>
  <Code

  <M>
    The choice of your tech stack is not the determining factor. When
    translating <B>design tokens</B> into code, the crucial aspect is to ensure
    that they align with the specifications outlined in <B>Figma</B> or{" "}
    <B>Confluence</B>. When designers decide to modify these tokens, it's
    imperative to synchronize these changes within your codebase.
  </M>
  <M>
    Furthermore, it's essential to incorporate the flexibility of overriding
    these decisions if a specific application necessitates such customization.{" "}
  </M>
  <M>
    Additionally, providing a straightforward method for applications to
    effortlessly integrate and utilize these tokens is a key consideration.

  <XL>Choosing tech stack</XL>
  <M>
    Imagine you have four applications, developed using <B>NextJS</B> and plain{" "}
    <B>SPA React</B>. These applications are equipped with <B>dark theme</B>{" "}
    support and consistently achieve impressive performance ratings of 90+ in
    the <B>Lighthouse</B> tool's performance tab. Presently, they implement
    styles using <B>SCSS</B> syntax, a simplification of the broader details to
    keep this article concise and manageable.
  </M>
  <M>
    One initial consideration is the creation of a <B>components library</B>{" "}
    using <B>Tailwind</B>, which seems like a promising approach. However, a
    significant roadblock arises: the existing styles in your applications are
    structured in separate files.
  </M>
  <M>
    Transitioning to <B>Tailwind</B> would necessitate a massive overhaul of the
    codebase, presenting substantial risks to the business. Given these
    challenges, it appears that adopting <B>Tailwind</B> is not a viable option.
  </M>
  <M>
    A more favorable option to consider is implementing the{" "}
    <B>styled-components</B> library. This choice offers the convenience of
    transferring existing styles from the <B>.scss</B> files by simply copying
    and pasting them. Developers would primarily need to add a wrapper for each
    component, significantly reducing the amount of work compared to
    transitioning to <B>Tailwind</B>.{" "}
  </M>
  <M>
    Moreover, <B>styled-components</B> enables the encapsulation of styles,
    diminishing the risk of global class collisions. This option appears to
    strike a good balance between compatibility with the current codebase and
    risk management.
  </M>
  <M>
    Indeed, while there are other alternatives, <B>styled-components</B> appears
    to be a strong and practical choice. It offers seamless theming options,
    enjoys widespread support, and is highly popular within the development
    community. Although it may result in a slight performance decrease of
    approximately 10% compared to <B>Tailwind</B> in <B>Lighthouse</B>, the
    associated risks are relatively low. This performance difference can be
    mitigated by adopting an <B>atomic-css</B> approach similar to{" "}
    <B>Tailwind</B>. The minimal configuration required for <B>NextJS</B> can be
    addressed by creating a small <B>PoC</B>, making it a manageable solution
    for your specific needs.
  </M>
  <M>
    It's a sound decision to opt for <B>React + styled-components</B> as the
    foundation for building your <B>React components library</B>. This choice
    aligns well with your requirements, and the associated risks are indeed
    quite manageable, making it a suitable and practical solution.
  </M>
  <Hint hasBg>
    You've hit the nail on the head - there's no such thing as a perfect tech
    stack. It's always a matter of weighing the <B>pros and cons</B> to find the
    right fit that aligns with your specific requirements and business
    objectives.

  <XL>What we build?</XL>
  <M>
    We're going to create the <B>FigaUI</B> library, tailored to meet our
    specific needs. This library will empower us to craft both straightforward
    and sophisticated components, providing the flexibility to share design
    tokens, customize the appearance, and maintain a scalable structure.

<Section>
  <XL>Starting from folders/files structure</XL>
  <M>
    There's no <B>one-size-fits-all</B> rule for this. Developers use various
    approaches like{" "}
    <A outside href="https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/">
      Atomic Design
    </A>{" "}
    or their own conventions. I'll go with my convention, but the most important
    thing is to be consistent when building components. The structure may change
    over time, but I usually use something like this:
  </M>
  <Code
    mode="dynamic"
    lang="css"
    description="The libraries structure"
    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polubis/Snippets-for-articles-and-lessons/main/Structuring%20design%20system%20code%20in%20React/3.yaml"
    linesCount={15}
  />
  <M>
    Alright, you might be wondering why I'm developing{" "}
    <B>four distinct libraries</B> to implement a <B>single design system</B>.
    Well, there are several compelling reasons for this approach:
  </M>
  <L>
    <Li>
      if someone wants to take the core of my design system and implement their
      own, they can simply load the "figa-ui-core" library, which will be
      lightweight,
    </Li>
    <Li>
      splitting extensive design systems into distinct libraries enhances my
      CI/CD process. It allows me to run tests separately, making it easier to
      identify where issues may arise in the layers,
    </Li>
    <Li>
      in a team of developers, dividing the work becomes more straightforward,
      and it helps minimize conflicts,
    </Li>
    <Li>
      if someone only needs the fundamental components of the design system,
      such as styles, links, buttons, and inputs, and wants to avoid the more
      complex components like calendars, grids, and tables, they can achieve
      this by simply importing "figa-ui-base" lib,
    </Li>
    <Li>
      breaking down the design system setup into separate libraries decreases
      the coupling between component code and configuration setup,
    </Li>
    <Li>
      having a designated facade for each layer simplifies migration to other
      technologies. For example, if "styled-components" were to become
      deprecated, you could easily replace it in "figa-ui-base" while ensuring
      that it fulfills the established contract,
    </Li>
    <Li>
      if someone wishes to replace a particular layer, they won't disrupt the
      others. They just need to ensure that the contract between libraries is
      upheld,
    </Li>
    <Li>
      this approach offers a significantly improved developer experience, with
      faster tests, the ability to work in isolation, and the option to open a
      single workspace, all while avoiding IDE lags,
    </Li>
  </L>
  <M>
    Structuring the internal code of the libraries will vary slightly depending
    on the library's purpose. In the case of <B>figa-ui-core</B>, the structure
    will encompass essential utilities, each residing in a separate file, with
    shared type definitions. These will all be re-exported for easy access.{" "}
  </M>
  <Image

    description="The figa-ui-core library structure"
  />
  <M>
    For <B>figa-ui-base</B> and <B>figa-ui-components</B>, scalability is
    crucial since there will be numerous files containing components, tests,
    models, and <B>Storybook</B> definitions. Placing them all within a single
    directory would result in a disorganized structure. To address this, we will
    create a separate directory for each component, following a consistent
    convention.
  </M>
  <Image

    description="The figa-ui-components library structure"
  />
  <M>
    The structure for <B>figa-ui-design-system</B> will involve distinct type
    definitions and re-exports consolidated in a single <B>index.ts</B> file.
    Moreover, it will incorporate a "wrapping" logic to facilitate the sharing
    of the design system across multiple components.
  </M>

    The use of numbers like 50, 100, etc., serves to encourage developers to

    This is the simplest place to work with! We'll include standalone components
    here that won't be part of the initial bundle, each with its individual
    style wrapper instead of global styles. Let's start with a basic imitation
    of a calendar widget.

    We have organized these four separate directories for each design system
    component, which could potentially become individual libraries with their
    own <B>package.json</B> files.
  </M>
  <M>
    However, for practicality, we've housed them within a <B>monorepo</B>. In
    the section below, you'll find an example of how this concept can be
    implemented in the linked repository, so feel free to explore this concept
    in more detail.

    In this article, we've primarily addressed the "structural" and
    "architectural" aspects of building a <B>robust design system</B>. However,
    creating a comprehensive design system involves much more. If you're

<Summary label="Conclusions and thoughts">
  <M>
    You've now learned how to effectively integrate <B>design system tokens</B>{" "}
    into your codebase and share them across components. Additionally, you
    understand how to structure a comprehensive design system to mitigate
    scalability issues and extend your codebase with ease.
  </M>
  <M>
    Remember that this is merely a proposal, and you can implement the same
    concepts in <B>Tailwind</B>, with an alternative structure, without{" "}
    <B>TypeScript</B>, and so on. The key is to maintain consistency and ensure
    you consume your design tokens within the created components.
