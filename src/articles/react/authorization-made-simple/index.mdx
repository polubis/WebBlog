<Prelude>
  <M>
    <B>Authorization</B> is one of the more common functionalities when it comes
    to web applications. Checking whether a user is logged in or not can
    generate a lot of code. Let's write some utils, that will make it easy.
  </M>
</Prelude>

<Section>
  <XL>1. Service</XL>
  <M>
    To fully illustrate the problem, we will use the prepared login mock API
    call. The following function waits 3 seconds and then simulates a BE query
    that returns a flag.
  </M>
  <Snippet
    linesCount={20}
    src="/snippets/authorization-made-simple/service.ts"
  />
</Section>

<Section>
  <XL>2. Provider</XL>
  <M>
    We create a <B>provider</B> that will hold information via the{" "}
    <B>Context API</B>. In <B>useEffect</B> we're calling backend for status.
  </M>
  <Snippet
    linesCount={54}
    src="/snippets/authorization-made-simple/provider.tsx"
  />
</Section>

<Section>
  <XL>3. Guards</XL>
  <M>
    Our custom hook will be used to implement <B>reusable</B> logic. We will now
    write two guards that depending on the values stored in the provider will
    render (or not) part of the UI.
  </M>
  <Snippet
    linesCount={46}
    src="/snippets/authorization-made-simple/guard.tsx"
  />
</Section>

<Section>
  <XL>4. Usage</XL>
  <M>
    It's time for a use case example. We are going to use the default layout
    rendered with <B>create-react-app</B>.
  </M>
  <Snippet
    linesCount={25}
    src="/snippets/authorization-made-simple/usage.tsx"
  />
  <M>
    As you can see, from now on hiding or showing parts of the layout is trivial
    🤡. Of course, let's not forget that we need to use our provider in the
    parent component 😉.
  </M>

<Summary>
  <M>
    In summary, this short article shows how authorization logic can be
    implemented with context API and some design patterns commonly used in
    React.
