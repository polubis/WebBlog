title: Build useForm hook in React
---

<Prelude>
  <M>
    Forms management can be tricky. During the development of a simple login
    form, of course, there is no option to have problems. Anyway, problems occur
    when there is a requirement for{" "}
    <B>multi-step forms, dynamic fields, async validation or customization</B>.
  </M>
  <M>
    Your first choice will be a library. It's not bad, generally, that's a good
    idea. However, if you need more advanced features or to fix bugs - there is
    a headache.
  </M>
  <M>
    In addition, there is a risk connected with library usage. They often lose
    support over time, then you need to migrate to other technologies. As a
    result, you might end up using other libs with code that is usually useless
    for you.
  </M>
  <M>
    I experienced this many, many times... Projects start, <B>formik</B> or
    other is installed, there is a feature which you need and right now it
    starts... The big pain of creating workarounds and adding additional
    dependencies, maintaining versions or even worse - rewriting your codebase
    because the lib which you used creates an impact on architecture -{" "}
    <B>redux-form</B>.
  </M>
  <M>
    So in this article, I'll try to show you, that there is nothing bad with
    creating something that already exists, because sometimes, under good
    conditions, it can be worthwhile -{" "}
    <B>
      "Software is a composition of iterations, hard work and knowledge (someone
      from the project, after not delivered sprint)"
    </B>
    .
  </M>
  <M>
    Let's create <B>useForm</B> hook and check how it will work with forms.
  </M>
  <Hint hasBg>
    Remember all custom solutions require additional maintenance. Use it wisely.

  <XL>1. What are we building?</XL>
  <M>
    It will be the multi-step form for user account creation. You can check how
    it works on{" "}

    . This app uses a hook which we implement for every form.

  <XL>2. Let's design our basic API</XL>
  <M>
    This is a really important step. We should cover all features and design dev
    friendly API.

  <XL>3. Creating test cases</XL>
  <M>
    Tests during development guarantee that you don't break anything after
    providing code changes.

    Please check the tests implementation in{" "}

  <XL>4. Adding type definitions</XL>
  <M>
    Before implementing real code, firstly you need to create the type
    definitions. It will be much easier to write code to fit them instead of
    adding it later. With unit tests and types, you can take it easy üëΩ. Green
    means it works.

<Section>
  <XL>5. Implementing values change API</XL>
  <M>
    It's time to write real code. Here you have basic logic which allows to
    update values via <B>set</B> and <B>change</B> functions. Second function
    contains additional logic which validates <B>event</B> object and informs
    you in runtime.
  </M>

  />
  <M>
    Yes, you used <B>useRef</B> hook for state management instead of{" "}
    <B>useState</B>. It's because <B>useRef</B> changes are immediete not async
    like via <B>useState</B> setter. It gives you opportunity to read always up
    to date data inside components or other custom hooks.
  </M>
  <Hint hasBg>
    This interesting usage has been described perfectly in{" "}

<Section>
  <XL>6. You need validation!</XL>
  <M>
    You need mechanism which will run functions passed via validation object to{" "}
    <B>useForm</B> hook and here it is.
  </M>
  <Code
    mode="dynamic"
    lang="ts"
    description="Validate with for loops in 2022"
    linesCount={44}
    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polubis/Build-useForm-hook-in-React/main/src/snippets/5-add-validation-function.ts"
  />
  <M>You used for loops because:</M>
  <L>
    <Li>
      They are a little bit faster than forEach() | reduce() | map() or others
    </Li>
    <Li>We have an option to stop execution at any time</Li>
  </L>
  <M>
    It can look a little bit old but the performance is much better. I'm 100%
    sure that <B>C++ devs</B> enjoy that ‚å®Ô∏è.
  </M>

<Section>
  <XL>7. Connect validation</XL>
  <M>
    Right now you just need to connect your <B>validate</B> function with{" "}
    <B>useForm</B> hook.
  </M>
  <Code
    mode="dynamic"
    lang="ts"
    description="Validation connected"

  />
</Section>

<Section>
  <XL>8. Attach metadata</XL>
  <M>
    Metadata is important. You definetelly need that to show different
    components on UI or highlight interactions.
  </M>
  <Code
    mode="dynamic"
    lang="ts"
    description="Metadata attached"
    linesCount={22}

  />
</Section>

<Section>
  <XL>9. Implement confirmation</XL>
  <M>
    Confirmation is equal to running validation for the whole form. It's
    important because sometimes you run validation always and sometimes only
    after the first submission. Depends on UX which you want to achieve.
  </M>
  <Code
    mode="dynamic"
    lang="ts"
    description="You can submit now"
    linesCount={17}

  <XL>10. Be able to reset</XL>
  <M>Simple function which resets state to initial.</M>

<Section>
  <XL>11. Push subscribe button</XL>
  <M>
    Right now you can subscribe for single field changes and perform side
    effects. Imagine a situation when a user types something in input and you
    need to perform the request. Here is the perfect place and also you can add{" "}
    <B>rxjs</B> operators.
  </M>
  <Code
    mode="dynamic"
    lang="ts"

  />
</Section>

<Section>
  <XL>12. Usage</XL>
  <M>
    Right now you can use <B>useForm</B> for all cases.

<Summary>
  <M>
    Right now you have a base API. You can use <B>Context API</B> if you don't
    like prop drilling or create <B>higher order component</B> with additional
    logic.
  </M>
  <M>
    Use these tools wisely. You need to understand the problems and benefits of
    technology and the techniques that you are using. Make sure that your
    project fits into solutions like those before you use them.
