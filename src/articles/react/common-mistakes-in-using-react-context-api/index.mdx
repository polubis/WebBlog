<Prelude label="Quick guide to React Context API">
  <M>
    Before delving into the nuances of good and bad practices with the{" "}
    <B>React Context API</B>, it's imperative to grasp how it functions and its
    underlying purpose. Picture a scenario where you have{" "}
    <B>five deeply nested components</B> requiring access to <B>state</B> at the
    top, along with <B>several functions</B> to update that state. It will look
    as follows:
  </M>
  <Code
    mode="dynamic"
    lang="tsx"
    description="Insane coupling of components"
    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polubis/Snippets-for-articles-and-lessons/main/Common%20mistakes%20in%20using%20React%20Context%20API/1.tsx"
    linesCount={22}
  />
  <M>
    If you're advocating for the use of the{" "}
    <B>components composition pattern</B>, your code might take a form similar
    to the following:
  </M>
  <Code
    mode="dynamic"
    lang="tsx"
    changed={[
      [7, 7],
      [11, 11],
      [15, 15],
      [22, 29],
    ]}
    description="A little bit better"

  />
  <M>
    This is where the <B>React Context API</B> proves its value. It steps in to
    alleviate the constraints posed by maintaining the{" "}
    <B>precise structure of the components tree</B> or{" "}
    <B>enforcing prop-drilling</B>.{" "}
  </M>
  <M>
    By offering a flexible mechanism for{" "}
    <B>sharing data throughout the component tree</B>, the Context API
    simplifies the process, providing a more dynamic and scalable solution to
    address complex needs. This flexibility is especially beneficial in
    scenarios where the structure of the component tree might change frequently
    - the real applications.
  </M>
  <Code
    mode="dynamic"
    lang="tsx"
    added={[
      [1, 1],
      [25, 33],

  <M>
    Indeed, the <B>React Context API</B> simplifies the code by eliminating the
    need for passing unnecessary props through components. Wrapping the
    components tree with a <B>Provider</B> and utilizing the dedicated hook{" "}
    <B>useContext</B> streamlines the process of accessing the required
    information at any level. This abstraction enhances code readability and
    maintenance, providing a cleaner and more efficient solution compared to{" "}
    <B>prop-drilling</B> or rigid <B>components composition patterns</B>.
  </M>
  <M>
    It's worth noting that the workload when using the <B>Context API</B> is
    significantly reduced from a developer's standpoint. You simply wrap the
    necessary components once, and wherever you need access, you can
    effortlessly utilize the dedicated <B>Context</B>.
  </M>
  <M>
    Moreover, if there are components in between that are not using the{" "}
    <B>Context API value</B>, and the value changes, their re-render will be
    skipped. You can observe this behavior in the <B>CodeSandbox</B> example I
    provided at the end of the article.

  <M>
    The last crucial aspect of the <B>Context API</B> is its inherent mechanism
    of <B>shadowing</B>. This means that if you employ <B>two</B> or{" "}
    <B>more wrappers</B>, it will consistently adopt the values provided by the
    latest one.

<Section>
  <XL>Using Context directly</XL>
  <M>
    What does <B>direct usage of context</B> entail? Let's revisit it for
    enhanced clarity:
  </M>
  <Code
    mode="dynamic"
    lang="tsx"
    description="The wrong usage of Context API"
    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polubis/Snippets-for-articles-and-lessons/main/Common%20mistakes%20in%20using%20React%20Context%20API/5.tsx"
    linesCount={25}
  />
  <M>
    Directly using context in this manner can be considered suboptimal for a few
    reasons:
  </M>
  <L ordered>
    <Li>
      "Limited reusability": components using context directly may be less
      reusable, as they are closely tied to a particular context,
    </Li>
    <Li>
      "Testing challenges": mocking or providing alternative contexts for
      testing purposes becomes less straightforward,
    </Li>
    <Li>
      "Readability and maintainability": code readability and maintainability
      can be compromised as the logic for accessing and utilizing context is
      dispersed throughout the component, potentially making it harder to follow
      and update,
    </Li>
    <Li>
      "Potential for shadowing issues": in scenarios with nested context
      providers, direct usage might lead to unintentional shadowing of context
      values, causing unexpected behavior
    </Li>
    <Li>
      "Dependency on a specific context structure": this approach makes the
      component tightly coupled to a specific context structure. If the context
      structure changes, it can lead to widespread updates in the components
      using it.
    </Li>
  </L>
  <M>
    To address these issues, a solution involves implementing a straightforward{" "}
    <B>abstraction</B> using a <B>custom hook</B> for <B>each context</B>. This
    approach removes the ability to directly access the <B>Context</B> and
    compels developers to consume APIs exclusively through a{" "}
    <B>single source of truth</B>.
  </M>
  <Code
    mode="dynamic"
    lang="tsx"
    changed={[
      [5, 5],

  />
  <M>
    This simple refinement not only addresses a multitude of potential issues
    during refactoring and structural changes but also promotes code
    consistency. By mandating a centralized pattern through a custom hook,
    maintenance becomes more straightforward, minimizing the risk of unintended
    consequences across the application.

<Section>
  <XL>Over-reliance on developers</XL>
  <M>
    Without implying any negativity, it's crucial to acknowledge that tasks
    prone to human error should be automated or validated wherever possible.
    We're all human, and various individuals, including backend developers or
    juniors who might not be well-versed in <B>React</B>, may interact with the
    code.
  </M>
  <M>
    In scenarios where someone forgets to add the necessary wrapper to the
    components tree, it could result in an ambiguous exception, typically
    something like <B>"Cannot read properties of undefined"</B>, creating
    unnecessary confusion for developers.{" "}

  <M>
    This issue arises when an object is passed as the provider's value, but the
    corresponding components tree isn't wrapped. In such cases, implementing
    custom exception handling becomes crucial to alert developers directly about
    this oversight, providing clear and actionable warnings. Therefore, in our

  <XL>Struggling with the initial state hell</XL>
  <M>
    The <B>createContext</B> function necessitates an initial state for
    functionality, as per the interface contract. However, it also mandates that
    this state "matches" the type specified in the <B>generic type parameter</B>.
    The practice of adding numerous empty functions and initial states is not only
    inefficient but also time-consuming.

  <M>
    Why is this problematic? Forgetting to use the <B>Context Provider</B> can
    result in <B>false positives</B> or <B>negatives</B> with this state.
    Moreover, it demands additional effort each time you introduce a new
    function, creating unnecessary overhead.

    Now, if someone forgets to include a provider or if the <B>Context value</B>{" "}

    Context should accommodate any kind of <B>ReactNode</B> - be it components,

<Section>
  <XL>Coupling of logic with propagation</XL>
  <M>
    As we know, <B>Context</B> is intended solely for sharing data across nested
    components trees. To adhere to the <B>single responsibility principle</B>,
    it's a bad idea to incorporate complex logic within the{" "}
    <B>Context provider</B>. Such an approach would result in a substantial
    amount of code being loaded whenever any component utilizing your context is
    rendered. To address this, consider improving it with lazy loading, as
    illustrated below:
  </M>
  <Code
    mode="dynamic"
    lang="tsx"
    description="Solution with lazy loading"
    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polubis/Snippets-for-articles-and-lessons/main/Common%20mistakes%20in%20using%20React%20Context%20API/18.tsx"
    linesCount={10}
  />
  <M>
    With the introduction of lazy loading, the code responsible for loading,
    located within a larger library, is now loaded only when the <B>load</B>{" "}
    action is triggered. However, this approach couples the propagation
    mechanism with application logic. Consequently, if you ever need to change
    the mechanism of business state transition, you would have to modify the
    propagation mechanism, breaking the <B>open/closed principle</B> from{" "}
    <B>SOLID</B>. A more effective solution exists that addresses these issues,
    ensuring the <B>Context provider</B> remains responsible only for
    facilitating state changes, keeping the bundle size minimal.
  </M>
  <Code
    mode="dynamic"
    lang="tsx"
    description="Custom hook for logic"

  />
  <M>
    As demonstrated, we crafted a custom hook for a significant portion of the
    logic responsible for loading articles. Here, we employed{" "}
    <B>dynamic import</B> to load a substantial code chunk dynamically.
    Furthermore, we've strategically placed the state change logic outside the{" "}
    <B>Context Provider</B>. This design choice affords flexibility – if you
    decide to adopt an alternative state propagation mechanism in the future,
    you can replace only the propagation logic, leaving the business logic
    untouched and initial bundle size minimal.
  </M>
</Section>

<Section>
  <XL>Excessive reliance on the Context API</XL>
  <M>
    The <B>React Context API</B> is designed for state propagation. Using it as
    a <B>state manager</B>, typically an architecture and data flow pattern, may
    be a mistake. Your initial choice might be to start with <B>Context</B>, but
    eventually, you may find yourself dealing with a complex <B>Providers</B>{" "}
    structure and coupling between <B>Providers</B> to consume logic from
    different application areas.
  </M>
  <Code
    mode="dynamic"
    lang="tsx"
    description="Providers hell "

  <M>
    Having something like this in your codebase indicates that you may be
    mishandling <B>Context</B>. It establishes a strong coupling between the{" "}
    <B>Providers</B> structure, making it nearly impossible to refactor or
    migrate to real state manager easily in the future.
  </M>
  <M>
    So, use <B>Context API</B> as a data propagation mechanism for presentation
    components to enhance developer experience or for managing simple global
    states like theme changes. However, it's not suitable for
    application-specific logic and data. Attempting to embed business needs in{" "}
    <B>Context</B> typically results in a convoluted and messy structure that
    requires refactoring later.
  </M>
  <M>
    You might consider flattening the providers using a function to improve
    visual readability. However, this approach introduces additional runtime
    performance overhead, and underneath, it still creates the same structure,
    ultimately masking the problem visually rather than addressing it.

  <M>
    To enhance this, consider opting for a dedicated state management tool
    rather than relying solely on <B>Context API</B>. The latter is not designed
