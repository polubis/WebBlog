title: Build useStepper hook in React
---

<Prelude>
  <M>Let's say you have a <B>simple screen with steps</B>. It can look more or less like the one in the gif below:
</M>

/>

<M>
  We'll write a <B>useStepper hook</B> with the basic functionality to change
  the step and protect us from potential bugs.
</M>

<M>
  In this hook we'll encapsulate common logic for changing steps, so later we
  don't have to repeat ourselves and we'll make it <B>type-safety</B>.
</M>

<M>
  <B>We want to avoid the following:</B>
</M>

<List items="Using the wrong key, Passing invalid props to the component, Moving beyond the range of steps, Displaying the wrong step, Making a mistake in the navigation logic" />
</Prelude>

<Section>
  <XL>1. The usage of useStepper</XL>
    <M>For a start, look at how we will use our hook. Pay attention to the hints that appear thanks to TypeScript.</M>

 <Code mode="static" lang="tsx" description="These functions blocks the possibility of passing bad parameters - they're type-guards!">{`import { useStepper } from './use-stepper';
 
interface EmailStepProps {
  onChange: React.ChangeEventHandler<HTMLInputElement>;
}
 
const EmailStep = ({ onChange }: EmailStepProps) => (
  <div>
    Type your email: <input onChange={onChange} />
  </div>
);
 
// Every step must have different key.
const steps = [
  { key: 'email', Component: EmailStep },
  {
    key: 'confirm',
    Component: ({ onClick }: { onClick: () => void }) => (
      <div>
        <button onClick={onClick}>Confirm</button>
      </div>
    ),
  },
  {
    key: 'error',
    Component: ({ onClick }: { onClick: () => void }) => (
      <button onClick={onClick}>Retry</button>
    ),

  { key: 'exception', Component: () => null },

// This will give us type-safety.
type Steps = typeof steps;

const RegisterForm = () => {
  const [Step, { is, next, previous, set }] = useStepper<Union, Steps>(
    'email',
    steps

  // Checks the equality of keys and renders the component.
  if (is(Step, 'email')) return <Step.Component onChange={previous} />;
 
  if (is(Step, 'error'))
    return <Step.Component onClick={() => set('confirm')} />;
 
  if (is(Step, 'confirm')) return <Step.Component onClick={next} />;
 
  if (is(Step, 'exception')) return <Step.Component />;
 
  // If this code will execute it means - we did something wrong - it
  // shouldn't happen!
  throw Error(
    'You did something wrong - there may be additional unsupported step!'
  );
};`}</Code>
  <M>What is happening in the posted image and code?</M>
  <M>We declared four steps. Each of them is different - look at props and return statements.</M>
  <M>Then we used <B>const</B> assertion, which makes <B> a read-only</B> tuple.</M>
  <M>After that, we created two auxiliary types that will be needed for our hook - the first is a simple <B>type alias</B>, and the second is a <B>union</B>.</M>
  <M>At the very end, we used our <B>useStepper</B> API. </M>
  <M>The <B>is()</B> function checks if the current step matches the passed key. If it does, there is a <B>type-guard</B> underneath, which marks <B>the component</B> as the one that matches the key.</M>
  <M>Therefore, later when we want to pass on not allowed properties to the component, we'll be blocked from doing that.</M>
 </Section>
 
<Section>
  <XL>2. Let's start with interfaces</XL>
  <M>We'll use the <B>types-first</B> approach, in which we focus on creating contracts at the beginning (before we start implementation) - so let's do that here:</M>

<Code mode="static" lang="tsx" description='This interface describes a single step - see the demo above'>
  {`import type { ReactNode } from 'react';
 
/** Interface that describes a single step. */
interface Step {
  /** Unique step key. */
  key: string;
  /** Render function - takes any number of arguments. */
  Component: (...args: any[]) => ReactNode;
}`}
</Code>
  <M>We used the notation <B>...any[]</B> because our <B>Component</B> function will take any number of arguments, not just a single props object (we do not want to limit developers).</M>
  
    <M>Now let's define what our future <B>useStepper</B> must receive as parameters. The first will be <B>the key</B> to the step we want to start with, and the second will be <B>a list of steps</B>.</M>
    
    <Code mode="static" lang="tsx" description='This is a tuple!'>
  {`/** Definition of the arguments that the hook will take. */
type UseStepperPayload<S extends Step, R extends readonly Step[]> = [
  S['key'], // It will be literal (not string) but exact value - '1', '2', ...etc.
  R // Type of passed steps array.
];
`}
</Code>
    <M>We used 2 generic types <B>(S, R)</B> - our step must have a <B>key</B> and a <B>Component</B>, but it can have something more. That's why we want to use generic types so that this "something more" can be remembered later. 
</M>
   <M>In addition, we will use these two generics, later on, to accurately describe what the hook will return and what each function will take. 
</M>
   <M><B>What will the hook return?</B>
</M>
    <Code mode="static" lang="tsx" description='The tuple again'>
  {`/** This must be returned by the hook. */
type UseStepperReturn<S extends Step> = [S, UseStepperActions<S>];`}
</Code>
<M>The step type we pass to the hook will be returned as the first element, and as the second element, we will return a list of functions to interact with our hook.</M>
<M><B>So what does UseStepperActions look like?</B></M>
    <Code mode="static" lang="tsx" description='The set of functions we will use'>
  {`interface UseStepperActions<S extends Step> {
  /**
   * A function that checks whether the step key is equal
   * to the specified key - if so, it assigns the appropriate
   * type (type-guard).
   */
  is: <S extends Step, K extends S['key']>(
    step: S,
    key: K
  ) => step is Extract<
    S,
    {
      key: K;
    }
  >;
  /** Goes to first step. */
  first: () => void;
  /** Goes to last step. */
  last: () => void;
  /** Sets previous step. */
  previous: () => void;
  /** Sets next step. */
  next: () => void;
  /** Sets the step by a specific key. */
  set: <K extends S['key']>(key: K) => void;
}`}
</Code>
<M>Only the first function needs to be discussed. An example of its use is: </M>
    <Code mode="static" lang="tsx" description='This is how the is() function will be used'>
  {`
  if (is(step, '1')) {
  // At this point we are sure that the 
  // step is definitely the one with key 1.
}
  `}
</Code>
   <M>
   Now only export left and that's it.
</M>
    <Code mode="static" lang="tsx">
  {`export type { Step, UseStepperActions, UseStepperReturn, UseStepperPayload };`}
</Code>
<M>Of course, we put all interfaces in a <B>separate file</B> - to preserve the <B>Separation of Concerns</B> principle and to <B>separate interfaces from implementation</B>.</M>
<Hint hasBg>You have all the interfaces in one file under <A href="https://github.com/polubis/Dream-stack-for-React-dev/blob/main/system/libs/figa-hooks/src/lib/use-stepper/defs.ts" outside>this link</A>.</Hint>

  <Section>
  <XL>3. First, let's use TDD</XL>
  <M>We're not going to paste a huge file with tests here - we'll link it below. We'll focus on why we want to write the tests first and then the implementation.</M>
  <M><B>Why did we choose this way?</B></M>
    <M>Because it will greatly speed up our work and make the solution more stable. We won't even have to start the browser - we'll write tests and implement the hook until tests will be green. Then we just need one manual test for final confirmation.</M>
       <Code mode="static" lang="tsx">
  {`import { renderHook } from '@testing-library/react';
import { useStepper } from './use-stepper';
import { act } from '@testing-library/react-hooks';
 
describe('Step can be changed when', () => {
  // This is how we will define the list of steps.
  const steps = [
    { key: '1', label: 'My label', Component: (props: { id: string }) => null },
    { key: '2', Component: (props: { number: string }) => <div>Text</div> },
    { key: '3', Component: () => null },
  ] as const; // This creates a readonly tuple.
  
  type Steps = typeof steps; // Alias type of steps.
  type UnionOfSteps = Steps[number]; // Union of objects from steps tuple.
})`}
</Code>
<M>Now let's write two simple tests. The first will check if the assigned initial step has been taken into account, and the second will verify the execution of the <B>set()</B> function.</M>
       <Code mode="static" lang="tsx" added={[[4,21]]}>
  {`
describe('Step can be changed when', () => {
  // ðŸ†™ Code from previous snippet. ðŸ†™
  
  // ðŸŸ¥ Currently it fails - useStepper is not implemented yet.
  it('starts with given step', () => {
    const { result } = renderHook(() =>
      useStepper<UnionOfSteps, Steps>('1', steps)
    );
 
    expect(result.current[0]).toEqual(steps[0]);
  });
  
  // ðŸŸ¥ Currently it fails - useStepper is not implemented yet.
  it('allows to set specific step', () => {
    const { result } = renderHook(() =>
      useStepper<UnionOfSteps, Steps>('1', steps)
    );
 
    act(() => {
      result.current[1].set('2');
    });
 
    expect(result.current[0]).toEqual(steps[1]);
  });
  
   // ðŸ”½ Other tests below - check the file at the end. ðŸ”½
})`}
</Code>
<M>We used the <B>renderHook</B> function from <B>@testing-library/react-hooks</B> to be able to test our <B>useStepper</B> without additional component creation.</M>
  <Hint hasBg>You have all the tests in one file under <A href="https://github.com/polubis/Dream-stack-for-React-dev/blob/main/system/libs/figa-hooks/src/lib/use-stepper/use-stepper.test.tsx" outside>this link</A>.</Hint>

  <Section>
  <XL>4. Making useStepper tests green</XL>
  <M>Now it remains to import the interfaces created earlier and add implementation to make our current tests pass.</M>
         <Code mode="static" lang="tsx">
  {`
import { useMemo, useState } from 'react';
import type { Step, UseStepperPayload, UseStepperReturn } from './defs';
 
const cannotFindStepError = 'Cannot find step';
 
const useStepper = <S extends Step, R extends readonly Step[]>(
  ...payload: UseStepperPayload<S, R>
): UseStepperReturn<S> => {
  const [initialKey, steps] = payload;
  const [key, setKey] = useState(initialKey);
  
  // Thanks to K extends S['key'] - only keys from steps
  // array can be used.
  const set = <K extends S['key']>(key: K): void => {
    setKey(key);
  };
  
  // We want to trigger find function only when 
  // steps or key will change.
  const step = useMemo(() => {
    const foundStep = steps.find((s) => s.key === key);
    
    if (!foundStep) {
      // This is situation when someone bypassed TypeScript
      // type-checking with any or other...
      throw new Error(cannotFindStepError);
    }
   
    // Here we make an assertion to tell -
    // "the found step have a type S".
    return foundStep as S;
  }, [key, steps]);
 
  return [step, { set }];
})`}
</Code>
<M>Thanks to previously created types and tests - implementation was child's play. All we had to do was push the keyboard buttons, and <B>TypeScript</B> with the power of <B>TDD</B>, guided us by the hand. Tests are green âœ….</M>
  <Hint hasBg>You have the whole implementation of the hook in a file under <A href="https://github.com/polubis/Dream-stack-for-React-dev/blob/main/system/libs/figa-hooks/src/lib/use-stepper/use-stepper.tsx" outside>this link</A>.</Hint>

<Section>
<XL>5. We discuss the is() function</XL>
<M>There is one more thing left to discuss - the <B>is()</B> function. We'll skip others because <B>first, last, previous, and next</B> are not worth to discussing - they are not fancy.</M>
    <Code mode="static" lang="tsx" description='What the heck is this syntax.'>
  {`
const is = <S extends Step, K extends S['key']>(
  step: S, // Type of step - it will be union from array of steps.
  key: K // The exact key value - it will be literal.
): step is Extract<S, { key: K }> => step.key === key;`}
</Code>
<M>The notation at the end means: if the specified <B>step</B> has the same <B>key</B> as the <B>expected key</B> then <B>the step type is equal to the specified key</B>.</M>
<M>Instead of doing something like this everywhere: </M>
    <Code mode="static" lang="tsx">
  {`
 // You can use '==' instead of '==='.
 if(step.key === '1') return ...
  `}
</Code>
<M>we'll write: </M>
    <Code mode="static" lang="tsx">
  {`
 // A little bit shorter and more concise.
 if(is(step, '1')) return ...
  `}
</Code>
<M>This function is not "indispensable" - rather fancy syntactic sugar.</M>
  <Hint hasBg>You have the whole implementation of the hook in a file under <A href="https://github.com/polubis/Dream-stack-for-React-dev/blob/main/system/libs/figa-hooks/src/lib/use-stepper/use-stepper.tsx" outside>this link</A>.</Hint>

  <Example>
  <M>At <A href="https://github.com/polubis/Dream-stack-for-React-dev/tree/main/system/libs/figa-hooks/src/lib/use-stepper" outside>this link</A>, you have the end result. Types, tests, implementation and re-exports.</M>
  </Example>
  
  <Summary>
  <M>Now you know how to handle the steps on the user interface interestingly. The created solution protects against many basic mistakes that can be made when implementing such functionality.</M>
    <M>
    <M>It is worth noting that the logic itself is simple - the complexity is introduced by TypeScript (as always). So it is up to you whether you want to use this solution with or without TS.</M>
