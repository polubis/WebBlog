<Prelude label="The context">
  <M>
    Before we delve into the content of article, it's essential to underscore
    the context. Our primary objective is to create{" "}
    <B>highly reusable components</B>. The utilization of these patterns is
    particularly beneficial when prioritizing maximum reusability, and it's
    important to note that the provided abstractions may not be necessary when
    crafting conventional application code. The examples we are about to explore
    are especially valuable when your goal is to develop a comprehensive
    reusable <B>components library</B>.
  </M>
</Prelude>

<Section>
  <XL>Few words about healthy components</XL>
  <M>
    The best component is the one, that can be used in <B>any</B> application.
    In addition, it should have:{" "}
  </M>
  <L>
    <Li>simple and easy to understand API</Li>
    <Li>type definitions in TypeScript or any other technology</Li>
    <Li>
      should be easy to extend without modifying the internal implementation
    </Li>
    <Li>should have the tests - it may be in "Jest" or any other technology</Li>
  </L>
  <M>
    Just like humans, our components can have symptoms that indicate a disease.
    Yes, I like metaphors... So in simple words, the perfect example of a
    healthy component is one, that can be <B>ctrl+c</B> and <B>ctrl+v</B> to
    other applications and it will work without any additional effort - just
    like a <B>library</B> that you are installing to your huge <B>JavaScript</B>{" "}
    projects.
  </M>
  <Hint hasBg>
    That definition is invented by <B>Me</B> - just to show what is exactly
    important in implementing good components, decoupled from the application
    domain.
  </Hint>
</Section>

<Section>
  <XL>Example of coupled and badly designed component</XL>
  <M>
    Respect your time. Think about that. If you're spending time to implement a
    component and you will do it badly, you'll never again be able to use it
    without big changes.
  </M>
  <M>
    Look at following one. I marked with ❌ the parts that are bad. Later we'll
    improve them.
  </M>
  <Code
    mode="static"
    lang="tsx"
  >{`// ❌ The component is coupled with the application domain model.
import type { Comment } from "@api/services";
 
// ❌ The callbacks have weird and intuitive names.
export interface CommentsProps {
  comments: Comment[];
  nextClicked: () => void;
  previous: () => void;
  itemClick: (comment: Comment) => void;
}
 
export const Comments = ({
  comments,
  nextClicked,
  previous,
  itemClick
}: CommentsProps) => {
  return (
    // ❌ There is no option to apply custom class.
    <div className="comments">
      {/* ❌ Header cannot be replaced with something else. */}
      <h3>Comments list</h3>
      <ul className="list">
        {comments.map((comment) => (
          // ❌ Only one list item type is supported.
          <li key={comment.id} className="list-item" onClick={itemClick}>
            {comment.content}
          </li>
        ))}
      </ul>
      {/* ❌ Only buttons can be used, any other case is impossible. */}
      <button onClick={previous}>See previous comments</button>
      <button onClick={nextClicked}>Load next comments</button>
    </div>
  );
};
`}</Code>
  <M>And that's how the usage may look like</M>
  <Code mode="static" lang="tsx">{`// @@@ The usage @@@
 
// It's a little bit ugly...
<Comments
  comments={[]}
  nextClicked={() => {}}
  previous={() => {}}
  itemClick={() => {}}
/>
 
// If we want to change the comments UI, we need
// to add wrappers or style directly in CSS...
<div className="some-wrapper-to-style">
  <Comments
    comments={[]}
    nextClicked={() => {}}
    previous={() => {}}
    itemClick={() => {}}
  />
</div>
`}</Code>
  <M>
    Firstly, we need to understand the responsibility of this component. It
    should render the list of comments and provide a header at the top, and a
    footer at the bottom.
  </M>
  <M>
    We need to provide the changes to <B>decouple</B> it from the application{" "}
    <B>domain</B>. We can use the <B>content projection</B> technique with the{" "}
    <B>children</B> property as a function - it's often called{" "}
    <B>function as a child pattern</B>.
  </M>
  <M>
    So, let's create a new component called <B>List</B> - why do we need a new
    one? It will be explained later ☜(ﾟヮﾟ☜).
  </M>
</Section>

<Section>
  <XL>Designing reusable and decoupled List component</XL>
  <M>
    We need a new component because we don't want to mess up the currently
    implemented <B>Comments</B> one. So, the plan is to create a <B>List</B>{" "}
    one, then check if it works separately ok, and then we'll use this{" "}
    <B>List</B> component inside the <B>Comments</B> component.
  </M>
  <M>That's how it will be used: </M>
  <Code
    mode="static"
    lang="tsx"
    description="The easiest variant"
  >{`export const Comments = () => {
  return (
    // We used injected ListItem component.
    <List<Comment> items={comments}>
      {({ item, ListItem }) => <ListItem {...item} key={item.id} />}
    </List>
  );
};`}</Code>
  <Code
    mode="static"
    lang="tsx"
    description="With custom list item"
  >{`export const CommentsWithOwnListItem = () => {
  return (
    // Here we want to use our custom
    // list item component.
    <List<Comment> items={comments}>
      {({ item }) => (
        <li key={item.id} className="different-item">
          {item.content}
        </li>
      )}
    </List>
  );
};`}</Code>
  <Code
    mode="static"
    lang="tsx"
    description="With header and footer nodes"
  >{`export const CommentsWithHeaderAndFooter = () => {
  return (
    // Here we added header and footer.
    <List<Comment>
      items={comments}
      header={<h1>My header!</h1>}
      footer={
        <footer>
          <button>First click button</button>
          <button>Second button</button>
        </footer>
      }
    >
      {({ item, ListItem }) => <ListItem {...item} key={item.id} />}
    </List>
  );
};`}</Code>
  <M>
    Look how we injected the model - <B>Comment</B> into the component. It's
    insanely safe to use right now. If you'll try to use not allowed property in
    the interface, <B>TypeScript</B> will warn you!
  </M>
</Section>

<Section>
  <XL>Creating type definitions for the List component</XL>
  <M>
    As usual, I'm starting from <B>type definitions</B> to be able to catch
    weird use cases. In addition, later I can reuse them in other component
    variants or maybe in components that consume the implemented one.
  </M>
  <Code mode="static" lang="tsx">{`import type { ReactNode } from "react";
 
// Base model for the ListItem component props.
interface ItemBase {
  id: string;
  content: string;
}
 
// Passed generic type must have at least "id" and "content".
export interface ListItemInjectedProps<T extends ItemBase> {
  item: T;
  index: number;
  ListItem: (props: ItemBase) => ReactNode;
}
 
export interface ListProps<T extends ItemBase> {
  items: T[];
  // We'll inject the "ListItem" component from children to parent
  // and the parent will decide what should be rendered.
  children: (props: ListItemInjectedProps<T>) => ReactNode;
  header?: ReactNode;
  footer?: ReactNode;
}
`}</Code>
  <M>
    We've used <B>generic - T</B> and <B>type constraints - extends</B> to
    verify a given generic type. It must have at least two properties -{" "}
    <B>id</B> and <B>content</B>.{" "}
  </M>
  <M>
    Another interesting part is the type definition for <B>ListItem</B>. It will
    be a function that takes props and returns a <B>ReactNode</B>.
  </M>
  <M>
    It will be completely clear what is going on when we start using these
    models to implement this component. Don't worry (～￣(OO)￣)ブ!
  </M>
</Section>

<Section>
  <XL>Let's implement the List component</XL>
  <M>
    Look at the following code in which we just imported previously created
    models, and compare it with the previous, starting implementation - a lot
    simpler, and you can pass your own header, footer and you can define the{" "}
    <B>ListItem</B> component.{" "}
  </M>
  <Code
    mode="static"
    lang="tsx"
  >{`import type { ItemBase, ListProps } from "./list.models";
 
// We don't want to export this component.
// It's internal implementation detail.
const ListItem = (props: ItemBase) => (
  <li className="list-item">{props.content}</li>
);
 
export const List = <T extends ItemBase>({
  items,
  header,
  footer,
  children
}: ListProps<T>) => {
  return (
    <div className="list-container">
      {header}
      {/* Here the all magic happens. We're calling in
      each iteration provided function as a child. */}
      <ul className="list">
        {items.map((item, index) => children({ item, index, ListItem }))}
      </ul>
      {footer}
    </div>
  );
};
`}</Code>
  <M>
    Now we can create as many <B>List</B> variants as we want, and we don't have
    ugly callbacks passed to the <B>Comments</B> component as previously. This
    code shows how greatly designed <B>React</B> is. You can compose any feature
    with greatly written components.
  </M>
  <M>How to use it? You've already seen this but let's check again!</M>
  <Code rolled mode="static" lang="tsx">{`
import type { Comment } from "@api/services";
 
const comments: Comment[] = [
  {
    id: "0",
    content: "My first comment brother!",
    date: new Date().toISOString()
  },
  {
    id: "1",
    content: "My second comment brother!",
    date: new Date().toISOString()
  }
];
 
export const Comments = () => {
  return (
    <List<Comment> items={comments}>
      {({ item, ListItem }) => <ListItem {...item} key={item.id} />}
    </List>
  );
};
 
export const CommentsWithOwnListItem = () => {
  return (
    <List<Comment> items={comments}>
      {({ item }) => (
        <li key={item.id} className="different-item">
          {item.content}
        </li>
      )}
    </List>
  );
};
 
export const CommentsWithHeaderAndFooter = () => {
  return (
    <List<Comment>
      items={comments}
      header={<h1>My header!</h1>}
      footer={
        <footer>
          <button>First click button</button>
          <button>Second button</button>
        </footer>
      }
    >
      {({ item, ListItem }) => <ListItem {...item} key={item.id} />}
    </List>
  );
};
`}</Code>

<Section>
  <XL>Making the List component more customizable</XL>
  <M>
    How about passing our own <B>className</B>, <B>events</B>, or other
    properties to the container node in our <B>List</B> component? Yea, that's
    what is missing! Let's extend the basic <B>ul</B> node props that{" "}
    <B>React</B> provides.
  </M>
  <Code
    changed={[
      [1, 1],
      [23, 23],
    ]}
    added={[
      [8, 11],
      [15, 15],
    ]}
    mode="static"
    lang="tsx"
  >{`import type { ReactNode, DetailedHTMLProps, HTMLAttributes } from "react";
 
export interface ItemBase {
  id: string;
  content: string;
}
// That's the native div element type definition.
type NativeContainerProps = DetailedHTMLProps<
  HTMLAttributes<HTMLDivElement>,
  HTMLDivElement
>;
// Here we removed the "children" property with "Omit".
// It's because we're using our own - the function
// passed as a child!
interface ListContainerProps extends Omit<NativeContainerProps, "children"> {}
 
export interface ListItemInjectedProps<T extends ItemBase> {
  item: T;
  index: number;
  ListItem: (props: ItemBase) => ReactNode;
}
// Here we merge our own properties with native ones!
export interface ListProps<T extends ItemBase> extends ListContainerProps {
  items: T[];
  children: (props: ListItemInjectedProps<T>) => ReactNode;
  header?: ReactNode;
  footer?: ReactNode;
}
`}</Code>
  <M>
    The last improvement and we will be ready to go! We need to use the{" "}
    <B>spread</B> operator and <B>rest</B> operator to maintain additional{" "}
    <B>props</B> and assign them to the <B>div</B> wrapper.
  </M>
  <Code
    added={[
      [6, 6],
      [9, 9],
      [16, 16],
      [17, 17],

    mode="static"
    lang="tsx"
  >{`
export const List = <T extends ItemBase>({
  items,
  header,
  footer,
  children,
  className,
  // We used the rest operator to assign other 
  // properties to variable "props".
  ...props
}: ListProps<T>) => {
  return (
    // We've used the spread operator to assign other props.
    // We destructured className. We want to merge incoming
    // class with default one.
    <div
      className={\`list-container\$\{className ? " " + className : ""\}\`}
      {...props}
    >
      {header}
      <ul className="list">
        {items.map((item, index) => children({ item, index, ListItem }))}
      </ul>
      {footer}
    </div>
  );
};
`}</Code>
  <M>
    Now we can pass any properties to the <B>List</B> component. Events, id,
    className, and everything that is defined in our interface.
  </M>
  <Code
    description="Now the sky is the limit"
    mode="static"

    The result is simple - we can create as many <B>List</B> variants as we
    want. Now you know how to decouple your components from the application
    domain and how to use techniques like <B>content projection</B>,{" "}
