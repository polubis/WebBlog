<Prelude>
  <M>
    When you compare the documentation and code written by developers, you can
    often find a completely different use for certain things.
  </M>
  <M>
    Technology is evolving and it's really problematic to handle all use cases -
    especially when you are writing libs/frameworks.
  </M>
  <M>
    A typical example of that is useRef() hook which sometimes is used by a
    community in a different way than described in the docs.
  </M>
  <M>Yup, that's right. That hook has more than one use case.</M>
</Prelude>

<Section>
  <XL>1. useRef() in documentation</XL>
  <M>
    Docs explain useRef() as a hook that allows you to read real DOM data during
    the component life cycle. For example, if you would like to read the
    position of HTML div in real DOM, useRef() is the perfect tool.

  <XL>2. Candidate for caching</XL>
  <M>
    We have a big user list that needs to be filtered by the query. This is an
    ideal candidate for caching. With caching - aka "flyweight" pattern - we can
    reduce the time complexity of the search algorithm. Of course, it increases
    memory usage but we're not building Mars lounger so who cares about the
    small amount of additional memory usage for better UX.
  </M>
  <M>
    As you probably figured out, in our search function we have a performance
    bottleneck.

<Section>
  <XL>3. Adding caching feature</XL>
  <M>To cache data in that case useRef() is an ideal candidate.</M>
  <M>
    It's because useRef() is 100% synchronous, which means you can read/write
    immediately. At this point you are using something similar to class property
    which can be changed during the object lifecycle.
  </M>

  />
  <Hint hasBg>
    You have right now the same behavior as class property without a class.
  </Hint>

<Section>
  <XL>4. Understanding sync vs async</XL>
  <M>
    Using useState() setter it can be described as request to change value.
    React decide when.
  </M>
  <M>Changing value in useRef() it's just immediate change.</M>
  <M>
    The same thing happened in your childhood when your mother asked you to take
    out the rubbish. It was also not an order but a request, and you did it late
    or not.

  />
</Section>

<Section>
  <XL>5. Read changes immediately</XL>
  <M>
    Look at handleChange() function call. We can read values immediately and
    they are always up to date. It's because of useRef() usage inside useForm()
    hook instead of useState().
  </M>
  <M>The setCounter() is used only for trigger rerender - that's all.</M>

</Example>

<Summary>
  <M>I hope you understand useRef() power now.</M>
  <M>
    Looks like someone again created a function with an unfriendly name 👽. As
    you saw useRef() can be used to access immediate state change, as cache and
    also, like an option to reading DOM data in real-time.

    and good health!
