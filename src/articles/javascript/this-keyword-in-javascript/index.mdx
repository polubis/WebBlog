title: This keyword in JavaScript

<Prelude>
  <M>
    While working with <B>JavaScript</B>, you've surely had a problem with{" "}
    <B>this</B>. It is not a simple and obvious topic.
  </M>
  <M>
    To understand how <B>this</B> works, we must first locate the problem, then
    solve it, and at the very end come to some conclusions.
  </M>
  <M>
    In that case, I have no other choice than to invite you to a lecture in
    which we will explain everything necessary and get to a conclusion on how to
    avoid the use of <B>this</B> keyword.
  </M>
</Prelude>

<Section>
  <XL>First time with "this"</XL>
  <M>
    Take a look at the following code, which is designed to create a specific
    list of <B>n</B> elements using the generic <B>List</B> class:
  </M>
  <Code mode="static" lang="ts">{`
"use strict"
// Abstraction with additional methods.
class List {
  items = [];
 
  constructor(length) {
    this.create(length);
  }
 
  create(length) {
    this.items = Array.from({ length }, (_, i) => i);
  }
   
  remove(idx) {
    this.items = this.items.filter((_, i) => i !== idx);
  }
}
 
// A specific list of users..
class UsersList {
  list = new List(10);
 
  handleRemove(idx) {
    // Removing a list item
    this.list.remove(idx); 
  }
}
 
const usersList = new UsersList();
usersList.handleRemove(9);
// Returns 9 elements.
console.log(usersList.list.items); 
`}</Code>
  <M>
    The code in this case will behave as we expect. <B>This</B> will point to
    instances of the class that is, in this case, the object created with{" "}
    <B>new</B>.
  </M>
  <M>
    So can we assume that <B>this</B> is a kind of variable that stores
    references to an object? This is true, but not exactly. It's not that
    simple...
  </M>
</Section>

<Section>
  <XL>The first problem with "this"</XL>
  <M>
    Imagine that a project manager comes in and says that deletion is supposed
    to be generic - a typical project situation (change in requirements). You
    don't know JS particularly well. The first thing that comes to your mind is
    to pass a <B>callback</B> to the <B>remove </B> function.
  </M>
  <M>
    So let's change the implementation of the <B>List</B> class:
  </M>
  <Code mode="static" lang="ts"
    changed={[
      [5, 7],
      [22, 22],
    ]}
    added={[
      [13, 13],
      [15, 18],
    ]}
  >{`
    "use strict"
     
class List { 
  // We changed the implementation to generic.
  remove(cb) {
    this.items = this.items.filter(cb);
  }
}
 
class UsersList {
  list = new List(10);
  // Auxiliary variable to store the item to be deleted.
  elementIdxToRemove = -1;
  
  removeUser(_, idx) {
     // Any condition.
     return this.elementIdxToRemove !== idx;
  } 
  
  handleRemove(idx) {
    // We are passing on the check function.
    this.list.remove(this.removeUser);
  }
}
`}</Code>
  <M>
    After trying to run the code, you will get something like this on your
    console:{" "}
    <B>Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'elementIdxToRemove')</B>.
  </M>
  <M>
    Well, but how! This was supposed to point to an instance of the <B>class</B>!
    Well, and it does point. Unfortunately not to the class. In this case, it points
    to <B>undefined</B>.
  </M>
  <M>
    <B>What?</B>
  </M>
  <M>
    What matters is how our <B>removeUser </B> function is called. For function{" "}
    <B>declarations </B> passed as an argument, <B>this</B> has the value{" "}
    <B>undefined</B>. This is simply how it is implemented. Every technology has
    some default behaviour.
  </M>
  <Hint hasBg>
    Rule 1: Function declarations passed as <B>callbacks</B> have <B>this</B>{" "}
    set as <B>undefined</B>.
  </Hint>
</Section>

<Section>
  <XL>How to fix it?</XL>
  <M>
    We need to assign the value of <B>this</B> to what it should be in the
    context of our code, that is, an instance of the <B>UsersList</B> class.
    After this procedure, it will start working properly.
  </M>
  <M>
    <B>How to achieve it?</B>
  </M>
  <M>
    The simplest way will be to use the <B>arrow function</B>, which will assign
    the value of <B>this</B> based on the nearest <B>lexical context</B> - in
    our case, the object created by the <B>UsersList</B> class, or more
    precisely, <B>this</B> of that object.
  </M>
  <Code mode="static" lang="ts"
    description="It's working again and we can go get some coffee"
    changed={[[1, 1]]}
  >{`removeUser = (_, idx) => {
  // "This" will now be an object created through "UsersList".
  // Previously it was a function declaration, and now it is an arrow function.
  return this.elementToRemove !== idx;
};
`}</Code>
  <Hint hasBg>
    Rule 2: Arrow functions assign a value of <B>this</B>, to the <B>this</B> of
    whatever is in the nearest lexical context - even if it's passed as a{" "}
    <B>callback</B>.
  </Hint>
</Section>

<Section>
  <XL>What is the lexical context?</XL>
  <M>
    In the lexical context, the <B>scope</B> is determined by where the variable
    is declared in the code.
  </M>
  <M>
    This means that the variable is available only inside the block, function or
    module in which it is declared and in all nested blocks and functions.
  </M>
  <M>
    Regardless of how the function is called, lexical context is determined by
    the <B>structure</B> of the code during processing by the JavaScript engine.
  </M>
  <Code mode="static" lang="ts">{`
  "use strict" 
   
function Test() {
  function outerThis() {
    // "This" it's undefined.
    console.log("Outer this " + this);
  }
 
  outerThis();
 
  const iHaveMyOwnThis = {
    innerThis: function () {
      // "This" iHaveMyOwnThis object.
      console.log("Inner this " + this);
    }
  };
 
  return iHaveMyOwnThis;
}
 
const test = Test();
test.innerThis();
`}</Code>
  <M>
    The closest in lexical context for the <B>outerThis</B> function is the{" "}
    <B>window</B> object. In contrast, for the <B>innerFunction</B> function, it
    is the <B>iHaveMyOwnThis</B> object.
  </M>
  <M>
    So why did <B>console.log</B> for <B>outerThis</B> showed <B>undefined</B>{" "}
    and not a <B>window</B>?
  </M>
  <M>And this is where another rule comes into play: </M>
  <Hint hasBg>
    Rule 3: For <B>use strict</B> mode, the value of <B>this</B> when pointing
    to a <B>global</B> object adopts the <B>undefined</B> value.
  </Hint>
  <M>
    <B>This</B> can be something different depending on the <B>environment</B>{" "}
    in which our code is running. In the case of a browser, it is a{" "}
    <B>window</B>, and in the case of <B>Node.js</B> it may be a <B>module</B>.
  </M>
  <M>
    It has been implemented this way to avoid unpleasant surprises when
    referring to object properties. It may turn out that{" "}
    <B>this.nameMethod()</B> will turn out to be the one belonging to the{" "}
    <B>window</B> object.
  </M>
  <M>
    Thanks to it, the developer is able to catch a potential problem at the
    moment of running the code - he immediately sees an exception when trying to
    refer to <B>this</B>, which can point to a <B>global</B> object.
  </M>

<Section>
  <XL>Implicit binding of "this"</XL>
  <Code mode="static" lang="ts">{`
  "use strict"
   
function bike() {
  console.log(this.name)
}
 
const obj1 = { name: "Pulsar", bike }
const obj2 = { name: "Gixxer", bike }
 
obj1.bike() // "Pulsar"
obj2.bike() // "Gixxer"
`}</Code>
  <M>
    In the above example inside the <B>bike</B> function, we use <B>this</B> to
    log the <B>name</B> value. When we assign the <B>bike</B> function
    declaration to any object then that object becomes <B>this</B>.
  </M>
  <Hint hasBg>
    Rule 4: If you assign a <B>function declaration</B> that uses <B>this</B> to
    an object, that object becomes <B>this</B> for that function.
  </Hint>
  <M>
    How will the code behave when we replace the <B>bike</B> function
    declaration with an <B>arrow function</B>?
  </M>
  <Code mode="static" lang="ts">{`
const bike = () => {
  console.log(this.name)
}
 
const obj1 = { name: "Pulsar", bike }
const obj2 = { name: "Gixxer", bike }
 
obj1.bike() // Here we get an exception ❌.
obj2.bike() // Here too❌.
`}</Code>
  <M>
    For both cases we get an exception:{" "}
    <B>Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'name)'</B>. Same reason as
    in the first example. The variable <B>this</B> points to a <B>window</B>{" "}
    object, which by <B>use strict</B> has the <B>undefined</B> value.
  </M>
</Section>

<Section>
  <XL>"This" in classes</XL>
  <M>
    If we create an object using <B>new</B>, then <B>this</B> will have the
    value of the created object. Therefore, in the following code, we have no
    problems.
  </M>
  <Code mode="static" lang="ts">{`
"use strict"
  
function Bike(name) {
  this.name = name;
   
  console.log(this.name);
 
  this.ride = function() {
    console.log(this.name);
  }
}
 
// "new" does the job.
const obj1 = new Bike('Pulsar'); 
const obj2 = new Bike('Gixxer');
  
obj1.ride(); // Pulsar
obj2.ride(); // Gixer`}</Code>
  <M>
    If we use the notation with the <B>class</B> and use <B>new</B>, the effect
    will be the same. The difference will be only in the syntax.
  </M>
  <Code mode="static" lang="ts" changed={[[3, 11]]}>{`
 "use strict"
  
class Bike {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }
 
  ride() {
    console.log(this.name);
  }
}
 
// "new" does the job.
const obj1 = new Bike('Pulsar');
const obj2 = new Bike('Gixxer');
   
obj1.ride(); // Pulsar
obj2.ride(); // Gixxer`}</Code>
  <Hint hasBg>
    Rule 5: When using <B>new</B>, the value of <B>this</B> will refer to the
    created object - the syntax (whether a class or a function as a constructor)
    does not matter here.
  </Hint>
</Section>

<Section>
   <XL>Inheritance in JavaScript, and "this"</XL>
     <M>
   What about <B>inheritance</B>? What guarantee do we have that we won't mess something up by referring to <B>this</B> in the <B>Vehicle</B> class? To prove it, we'll pass <B>this</B> as an argument to the <B>repair</B> method, and then check how the result behaves based on different call locations and based on different arguments.
  </M>
  <Code mode="static" lang="ts"
  >{`
"use strict"
  
class Vehicle {
  repair(thisArg) {
     console.log(this === thisArg);
  }
}
  
class Bike extends Vehicle {
  printInnerThis() {
     this.repair(this);
     super.repair(this);
  }
}
  
const bike = new Bike();
 
// Here "this" is an instance of the class "Bike".
bike.printInnerThis(); // true, true
// Here "this" is "undefined" - we did not pass it, so "false".
bike.repair(); // false
// Here "this" is an instance of the class "Bike", but passed explicitly.
bike.repair(bike); // true
`}</Code>
  <M>
    In the first <B>console.log</B> we have 2x the value <B>true</B>. It shows that by referring to <B>this</B> inside the <B>Bike</B> and <B>Vehicle</B> classes, we are sure that <B>this</B> for the parent and child classes is the same.
  </M>
  <M>In the third case, we have <B>true</B>. We passed a <B>bike</B> object, and we already know that after using <B>new</B>, the value of <B>this</B> points to an <B>instance</B> of an object. Also, we know that <B>this</B> of the <B>parent</B> and <B>child</B> classes points to the same thing. In that case, <B>this</B> in the context of two mentioned classes is the same as the created <B>bike</B> object that we passed as an <B>argument</B> to its own <B>repair</B> method.</M>
    <Hint hasBg>
  Rule 6: With inheritance, <B>this</B> refers to the same thing in the <B>parent</B> and <B>child</B> classes (to the same object instance).
  </Hint>
</Section>

<Section>
  <XL>"Static" keyword and "this"</XL>
  <M>Here is a little more interesting. Take a look at the code below: </M>
  <Code mode="static" lang="ts"
  >{`
  "use strict"
   
class Vehicle {
  describe() {
    console.log(this.company);
  }
}
 
class Bike extends Vehicle {
  static someName = this.name; 
  
  static getMetadata() {
    console.log(this.name); 
    console.log(this.prototype); 
  }
}
 
Bike.getMetadata(); // Bike, Vehicle class
console.log(Bike.name); // Bike
`}</Code>
  <M>
    In the case of fields and static methods, <B>this</B> takes the value of a
    class, not an instance of an object - it's not there yet and will not be.
    After all, it's a static method.
  </M>
  <Hint hasBg>
    Rule 7: For static fields, <B>this</B> refers to the <B>class</B>.
  </Hint>
</Section>

<Section>
  <XL>Explicit binding of "this"</XL>
  <M>
Until now, we have relied on "magic" JavaScript mechanisms that set the value of <B>this</B> for us depending on what we do in the code.
  </M>
  <M>
    <B>Is it possible to set this up ourselves?</B>
  </M>
  <M>Of course, it is!</M>
  <Code mode="static" lang="ts">{`
  "use strict"
  
function Bike() {
  console.log(this.name);
}
 
const obj = { name: "Pulsar" }
 
Bike.call(obj); // "Pulsar"
Bike.apply(obj, ['argument1', 'argument2']); // Pulsar`}</Code>
  <M>
Most functions allow you to pass something described as <B>thisArg</B>. In the above example, we called the <B>Bike</B> function using <B>call</B>. Next, we passed an <B>obj</B> object as <B>this</B>.
  </M>
  <M>
 Later we did the same with <B>apply</B>, which allows us to call functions with multiple arguments. In other words, we controlled the binding of <B>this</B>.
  </M>
  <M>This can even be done for functions such as <B>forEach</B>:</M> 
  <Code mode="static" lang="ts">{`function logThis() {
  console.log(this.name);
}
[1, 2, 3].forEach(logThis, { name: "hi" }); // 3x hi
`}</Code>

   <Hint hasBg>Rule 8: We can set the value of <B>this</B> explicitly using the <B>call</B> or <B>apply</B> method or by passing the additional argument <B>thisArg</B> to methods such as <B>forEach</B>.</Hint>
</Section>

<Section>
  <XL>Hard/fixed binding of "this"</XL>
  <M>
    It can be done in yet another way. There is a special <B>bind</B> method
    that allows us to set the value of <B>this</B> not at the time when the
    function is called, but at any time. Instead of keeping an eye on the value
    of <B>this</B> for each call, we can do it only once - in the{" "}
    <B>constructor</B>.
  </M>
  <Code mode="static" lang="ts" added={[[23, 28]]}>{`
  "use strict"
   
class List {
  items = [];
 
  constructor(length) {
    this.create(length);
  }
 
  create(length) {
    this.items = Array.from({ length }, (_, i) => i);
  }
 
  remove(cb) {
    this.items = this.items.filter(cb);
  }
}
 
class UsersList {
  list = new List(10);
  elementIdxToRemove = -1;
 
  constructor() {
    // We overwrote the function with its new cloned version
    // with a completely new "this". Which in this case
    // refers to the "UsersList" instance.
    this.removeUser = this.removeUser.bind(this);
  }
 
  removeUser(_, idx) {
    return this.elementIdxToRemove !== idx;
  }
 
  handleRemove(idx) {
    this.elementIdxToRemove = idx;
    this.list.remove(this.removeUser);
  }
}
 
const usersList = new UsersList();
usersList.handleRemove(9);
console.log(usersList.list.items); // Returns 9 elements.
`}</Code>
  <Hint hasBg>
    Rule 9: We can set <B>this</B> using the <B>bind</B> method, which creates a
    copy of the function and allows you to pass your own <B>this</B>.
  </Hint>
</Section>

<Section>
  <XL>Getting rid of "this"</XL>
  <M>
    We can avoid referring to <B>this</B> simply by writing the code in
    functional way. Take a look at the example below, in which we converted
    object-oriented <B>code</B> to a functional approach and we removed{" "}
    <B>this</B> entirely.
  </M>
  <Code mode="static" lang="ts">{`"use strict";
 
const List = (length) => {
  let items = [];
 
  function create() {
    items = Array.from({ length }, (_, i) => i);
  }
  
  function remove(cb) {
    items = items.filter(cb);
  }
  
  create();
  
  return {
    items,
    create,
    remove
  };
};
  
const UsersList = () => {
  const list = List(10);
  let elementIdxToRemove = -1;
  
  function removeUser(_, idx) {
    return elementIdxToRemove !== idx;
  }
  
  return {
    handleRemove(idx) {
      elementIdxToRemove = idx;
      list.remove(removeUser);
    },
    list,
    elementIdxToRemove
  };
};
 
const usersList = UsersList();
usersList.handleRemove(9);
// Returns 9 elements.
console.log(usersList.list.items);
`}</Code>
  <M>
    Instead of referring to <B>this</B>, now we rely on the <B>closure</B>{" "}
    mechanism. If you are interested in how it works, feel free to check{" "}

    Rule 10 (thank goodness probably the last one): We can remove <B>this</B>{" "}

  </Hint>
</Section>

<Summary>
  <M>
    If we leave the setting of <B>this</B> value to the JavaScript engine then
    we need to know all the rules. It is a bit complicated. For sanity's sake, I
    recommend always using <B>arrow functions</B> or simple methods such as{" "}
    <B>call</B>, <B>apply</B> and <B>bind</B> that allow you to pass/set{" "}
    <B>this</B>.
  </M>
  <M>
    The second option, a little more invasive, is to change the paradigm to a
    functional one.
  </M>
  <M>
    The whole concept of <B>this</B> is another element of the language that
    sooner or later you need to understand thoroughly to write code consciously
    and not expose yourself to numerous problems.
