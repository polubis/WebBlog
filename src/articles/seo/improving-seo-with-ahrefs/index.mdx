<Prelude>
  <M>
    If you've ever read about <B>SEO</B>, you've probably come to the same
    conclusion as I have - <B>it's not a simple subject</B>. It can be
    incredibly frustrating...
  </M>
  <M>
    Website positioning requires the knowledge of good practices and a lot of
    experience. My knowledge in this area is rather basic. I've spent a lot of
    time reading. The Internet is full of tips and tricks on how to improve SEO,
    but testing whether they make sense takes too much time.
  </M>
  <M>
    One lovely morning the tool fell into my hands, which removed the most of
    the ills. Above all, it saved time and relieved me from manually testing the
    site's metadata. About this invention in today's entry.
  </M>
  <Hint hasBg>
    I am greedy! Instead of learning or hiring someone, I found a ready-made
    solution.

  <XL>1. Why Ahrefs?</XL>
  <M>
    Well... It has everything I was looking for. Reports, knowledge,
    notifications to email and a free plan. Let's check out what a sample report
    looks like.
  </M>

  />
  <M>
    How does it work? When you upload a new version of your site to the server,
    you can generate a report. The tool will create a summary. Then, it will
    compare the new and old versions. It will show you potential regression and
    allow you to understand which sites are problematic.
  </M>
  <M>
    Here's something else. Reports are generated in cycles from time to time. So
    you can track progress on your site. After the generation of cyclic report
    you will receive an email with the summary.

  <XL>2. How to start with Ahrefs?</XL>

  <XL>3. Auditing my site with Ahrefs</XL>
  <M>
    I'm sitting and playing <B>"Path of Exile"</B>, a kitten on my knees and a
    coffee next to me. Suddenly, a notification arrives on my email.
  </M>
  <Img
    src="/assets/improving-seo-with-ahrefs/ahrefs.jpg"
    description="Looks like some kind of problem :/"
  />
  <M>
    Holy cow. It shows that I have 0 errors, 50 warnings and 42 suggestions.
    What it means?
  </M>
  <List items="Errors will definitely affect your site negatively, Warnings may affect your site negatively, Suggestions are additional improvements for SEO purists" />
  <M>
    Also you can see that compared to the last version of the page I have one
    warning less (this value -1 in green).
  </M>
  <Hint hasBg>Somehow I got something right. Kudos to me.</Hint>
</Section>

<Section>
  <XL>4. Let's analyse the report</XL>
  <M>
    I clicked the link to the full report and then I started checking. The first
    problem as you can see is that the page descriptions are too short.
  </M>
  <Img src="/assets/improving-seo-with-ahrefs/description-link.jpg" />
  <M>
    So I click and it shows me a list of sites affected by this particular
    problem. Let's focus on the first one (the home page).
  </M>
  <Img src="/assets/improving-seo-with-ahrefs/problems.jpg" />
  <M>
    When we click on it, we can see an additional panel where we have displayed
    the reason and a possible solution. My description is only 65 characters
    long, while it should be in the 110-160 characters range.
  </M>
  <Img
    src="/assets/improving-seo-with-ahrefs/panel.png"
    description="1 warning and 1 suggestion"
  />
  <M>
    I added 70 spaces and the problem solved. Of course, I'm just kidding. I
    added a fancy description from a buddy (124 characters).
  </M>

<Section>
  <XL>5. Let's check the fix</XL>
  <M>
    I published a new version of the site. It wasn't something urgent. So I
    spent the week doing other useful things - I have played the "Path of
    Exile." After some time, the report came in.
  </M>
  <Img
    src="/assets/improving-seo-with-ahrefs/final.jpg"
    description="Now better"
  />
  <M>
    The new report shows that there is one <B>warning</B> less, so the fix
    worked.
  </M>

<Summary>
  <M>
    After reading this post, you already know how to improve SEO with the{" "}
    <B>Ahrefs</B> tool. In that case, is it enough to have a good tool and the
    problem is over? No! It's just a helper, but further we have to learn on our
    own. Now it is much much easier, but this is the tip of the iceberg.
