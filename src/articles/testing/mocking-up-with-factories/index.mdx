title: Mocking up with factories

<Prelude>
  <M>
    Mocking is a common practice during application testing, and sometimes also
    in application logic (when backend is not ready yet).
  </M>
  <M>In this article we will explore best practices for mocks creation.</M>
</Prelude>

<Section>
  <XL>1. The problem</XL>
  <M>Imagine the situation when you have two endpoints:</M>
  <List items="get/users,/get/users/:id" />
  <M>
    Both of them return the same entity - user object. That object can be
    described with following interface:
  </M>
  <Snippet
    description="User shape"
    linesCount={16}
    src="/snippets/mocking-up-with-factories/typical-mock.ts"
  />
  <M>
    Nothing fancy. When you call these API's, they will return{" "}
    <B>list of users</B> and <B>user by id</B>. So let's use a typical UI/logic
    implementation for this.
  </M>
  <Snippet
    description="Mocks used in application"
    linesCount={47}
    src="/snippets/mocking-up-with-factories/typical-mock-usage.tsx"
  />
  <M>
    If you will have more layers in your architecture, it will be more
    complicated. In addition, there will be a need to apply same mocks in tests.
  </M>
  <Snippet
    description="Mocks used in testing"
    linesCount={20}
    src="/snippets/mocking-up-with-factories/typical-mocks-in-tests.test.ts"
  />
  <M>
    So where is the problem? Think about that in perspective of code
    maintenance. If you want to change the shape of an object you need to change
    every place in app where this object is imported and used. Also, this is the
    same instance of object so you can mess up your tests.
  </M>
</Section>

<Section>
  <XL>2. Factories for the rescue</XL>
  <M>
    <B>Factory method</B> is a simple design pattern which reduces complexity of
    object creation and moves this logic to separate, encapsulated code.
  </M>
  <M>
    So instead of importing static object, we will import a function (factory
    method) which will create this object for us based on configuration or
    chained methods call.
  </M>
  <Snippet
    description="Factory created!"
    linesCount={27}
    src="/snippets/mocking-up-with-factories/users-factory.ts"
  />
  <M>
    You're using function to generate always new object. With factory you can
    chain methods to achieve object shape which you need.
  </M>
  <Snippet
    description="Refactors friendly mocking"
    linesCount={49}
    src="/snippets/mocking-up-with-factories/improved-mock-usage.tsx"
  />
  <M>Same for tests.</M>
  <Snippet
    description="Tests improved"
    linesCount={20}
    src="/snippets/mocking-up-with-factories/improved-mocks-in-tests.test.ts"
  />
  <M>
    We have only 2 files but imagine the mess which you can avoid and time spend
    on refactor in bigger apps.
  </M>
</Section>

<Summary>
  <M>
    Nothing more to add. It's a really simple quick win. I'm using it in all of
    my projects. It also boosts development for green field projects when
    backend is not ready yet.
  </M>
  <M>
    Feel free to contact me if you have any questions/proposals. Have a nice day
    and good health!
