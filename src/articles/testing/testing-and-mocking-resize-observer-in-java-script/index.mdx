<Prelude label="The value of basics">
  <M>
    Crafting tests in <B>Jest</B> for <B>React components</B>, <B>hooks</B>, or
    other pure <B>JavaScript</B> utility functions can pose a challenge.
  </M>
  <M>
    As a developer, be prepared for encountering perplexing errors that may seem
    nonsensical during test execution, and be ready to delve into the task of
    mocking intricate browser APIs when needed.
  </M>
  <M>
    That's why having a solid grasp of the fundamentals of the technology you're
    working with, such as <B>Jest</B> in this context, is important. The
    seemingly perplexing errors start to make sense once you have a deeper
    understanding of how the technology operates ðŸ’«.
  </M>
</Prelude>

<Section>
  <XL>How "Jest" works?</XL>
  <M>
    <B>Jest</B> primarily operates in a <B>NodeJS</B> environment and does not
    use real browser APIs for testing. It's widely used for unit testing,
    integration testing, and snapshot testing.
  </M>
  <M>
    <B>Jest</B> includes a built-in test runner, assertion library, and mocking
    capabilities. It does not interact directly with browser APIs. <B>Jest</B>{" "}
    is well-suited for testing <B>JavaScript</B> code outside of the browser
    context, making it especially useful for testing server-side code,
    libraries, and components that do not rely on browser-specific features.
  </M>
  <M>
    Ok, so how I'm able to test my <B>React</B> components?
  </M>
  <M>
    When testing code that interacts with browser-specific features or APIs, the
    browser APIs are mocked. Mocking allows you to simulate the behavior of
    these APIs without actually making real browser calls, making it possible to
    run tests in a controlled and predictable environment.
  </M>
  <M>
    When using <B>Jest</B> or similar testing frameworks, it's crucial to be
    aware of the need to mock browser APIs, especially for newer APIs that might
    not be automatically mocked. If you forget to mock a specific API, you might
    encounter errors like <B>"NameOfTheAPI is not defined"</B> during test
    execution.
  </M>
</Section>

<Section>
  <XL>The annoying "ResizeObserver is not defined" error</XL>
  <M>
    If you've written at least one test involving the <B>ResizeObserver</B> in{" "}
    <B>Jest</B> or another modern web API, you might have come across the
    perplexing error: <B>"ResizeObserver is not defined"</B> - depends on{" "}
    <B>Jest</B> version you're using.
  </M>
  <M>
    This occurs because <B>Jest</B> prioritizes delivering maximum test
    execution speed for developers. It's a straightforward trade-off:{" "}
    <B>Jest</B> significantly speeds up your tests, but they depend on mocked
    browser APIs rather than the real ones.
  </M>
  <M>
    Therefore, if you're working with particular versions of the <B>jest</B> or{" "}
    <B>jest-dom</B> libraries, you might encounter errors like the one
    mentioned. This is because, for certain library versions, the corresponding
    API may not be mocked yet, especially if it's relatively new.
  </M>
  <M>
    Let's see it on the <B>GIF</B>:{" "}

  <M>
    In the example provided, we have a <B>Popover</B> component that relies on a{" "}
    <B>ResizeObserver</B> to align the popover position when the element's width
    or height changes, aiming to maximize the user experience.

  <XL>How to solve "ResizeObserver is not defined" error?</XL>
  <M>Basically, you have two options:</M>
  <L ordered>
    <Li>
      update "Jest" package version and pray for having mock added by
      maintainers,
    </Li>
    <Li>add your own mock.</Li>
  </L>
  <M>
    For this particular article, we'll incorporate our own <B>mock</B> since
    it's a more straightforward and faster approach.
  </M>
  <M>
    So, let's say you have a <B>ResizeObserver</B> that is used inside{" "}
    <B>useElementSize</B> hook which, is utilized within the <B>Popover</B>{" "}
    component to measure the element size. The implementation of the entire hook
    is not crucial for our discussion, and the same applies to the{" "}
    <B>Popover</B> component. For our current focus, we'll delve into the{" "}
    <B>ResizeObserver</B>, which is the problematic aspect.
  </M>
  <Code
    mode="dynamic"
    lang="tsx"
    description="The partial useElementSize hook implementation"
    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polubis/Snippets-for-articles-and-lessons/main/Testing%20and%20mocking%20ResizeObserver%20in%20JavaScript/1.ts"

    linesCount={6}
  />
  <M>Now, let's say we want to test the two aspects of our hook:</M>
  <L ordered>
    <Li>listening for the resize of the element,</Li>
    <Li>cleaning listeners when the parent component unmounts.</Li>
  </L>
  <M>
    First of all, we need to mock <B>ResizeObserver</B> that we're using to
    ensure a smooth testing experience and eliminate the "
    <B>ResizeObserver is not defined</B>" error.
  </M>
  <Code
    mode="dynamic"
    lang="tsx"

    linesCount={15}
  />
  <M>
    Now, it's time for testing the resize callback that will be triggered during
    the resize event.
  </M>
  <Code
    mode="dynamic"
    lang="tsx"
    description="The example of Component to render"
    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polubis/Snippets-for-articles-and-lessons/main/Testing%20and%20mocking%20ResizeObserver%20in%20JavaScript/4.ts"

    linesCount={31}
  />
  <M>
    Last, we need to test if the <B>disconnect</B> function is called when the
    parent component unmounts. To achieve that, we need the following test.
    Right now, the <B>additional</B> component is not required. We may test it
    directly via the <B>renderHook</B> function.
  </M>
  <Code
    mode="dynamic"
    lang="tsx"
    description="The disconnect mechanism test"

    linesCount={14}
  />
  <M>
    After these steps, tests will be green thanks to the successful mocking of{" "}
    <B>ResizeObserver</B> for these particular cases.
  </M>
  <Hint hasBg>
    Did you know that there are frameworks for unit and integration testing like{" "}
    <B>Jasmine</B>, which, although slower, eliminates the entire need for
    mocking browser APIs? This is because, under the hood, the real APIs are
    used.

<Summary label="Conclusions and thoughts">
  <M>
    After this article, you know what goes on under the hood in <B>Jest</B>{" "}
    library and the pros and cons of using it in your testing code. While{" "}
    <B>Jest</B> is exceptionally fast, it comes with a small downfall - we need
    to mock many APIs inside our testing code, and we'll never be entirely sure
    that the tested code will work precisely as expected inside our browser.
  </M>
  <M>
    However, we know how to resolve popular errors that may occur during test
    execution. If you encounter a similar issue with a different browser API
    than <B>ResizeObserver</B>, you'll be able to easily fix this problem.
  </M>
  <M>
    If you want to ensure that your code is working correctly in a real browser,
    you need to use tools like <B>Cypress</B> or <B>Playwright</B> to write{" "}
    <B>E2E tests</B> or utilize <B>Jasmine</B> technology. At the end, it's a
    topic for other articles.
