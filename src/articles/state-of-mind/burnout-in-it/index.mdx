<Prelude>
  <M>
    It's funny that despite the fact that man is theoretically able to learn
    from the mistakes of others, I was not able to.
  </M>
  <M>
    Busyness, family issues, hard times in the project and other traumas - if
    they happen separately, we can deal with them.
  </M>
  <M>
    What if everything hits at the same time? Today I will unveil myself to you,
    the reader, just so that you don't make the same mistakes as me.
  </M>
  <Hint hasBg>
    Before we begin I ask you to understand that I am not a psychologist. I just
    want to make you think, so that you don't do to yourself what I did.

  <XL>1. What is passion?</XL>
  <M>
    Until a year ago, I loved programming. I could boldly call it a passion. If
    a person does what he loves, he can't get tired of it.
  </M>
  <M>
    I heard some time ago that programming is not a job, that it is something
    more. I thought exactly the same. The opportunity to create, solve problems
    and that satisfaction at the end, is a feeling that is like a sip of beer
    with friends.
  </M>
  <M>
    Passion is something that gives life meaning. What makes a person forget
    about everything around him. Something that propels you constantly and is
    like a reactor in your body. Also something that makes a person feel more
    appreciative, that makes him feel a better person. After all, it is in human
    nature to be curious.
  </M>
  <M>
    At least that's what I thought until I discovered that passion is also a
    huge burden, especially if it's also your job.

  <XL>2. Today's programmer</XL>
  <M>
    A programmer has to constantly solve problems and set himself new challenges
    in order to be good at it and not get out of practice. After all, doing the
    same thing over and over again is a step backwards.
  </M>
  <M>
    Eight hours at work is a joke. We take our work home with us. We think about
    how to solve something in the shower, while running or doing other
    activities. The real relief comes from something that engages us 100% - in
    my case it was games or playing the guitar.
  </M>
  <M>
    This is not a full-time job. You work more, there inside yourself,
    subliminal, subconscious. Don't take on more if you don't understand that,
    and there are other things, after all.
  </M>
  <M>
    Consider, too, that many programmers work after hours, whether on a project
    for a client or developing their own projects.
  </M>
  <M>
    So a lot of it. Add to that other things that need to be taken care of and a
    lot of stress related to deadlines and whether I can complete the task at
    all.
  </M>
  <M>
    In addition to good money there is also a lot of stress, which can poison
    and exhaust you. Working in a well-organized project we experience little of
    it, but there are toxic ones, in which all the responsibility is shifted to
    the programmer.
  </M>
  <M>
    There are the consequences, the contractual penalties, the feeling of being
    capable if the work just doesn't go. Take all this into account, this I say
    especially to people who want to enter this industry - it's disgustingly
    stressful, and influencers and youtubers tend to bend reality.
