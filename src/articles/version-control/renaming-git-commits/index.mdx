    To set the stage, picture yourself on a branch named{" "}
    <B>feature/admin-panel</B>, derived from <B>develop</B>. Whether pushing
    unsightly or polished commits, the <B>develop</B> branch enforces commit
    conventions via a <B>Commitlint-inspired</B> pipeline. Now, let's delve into
    the process of renaming commits.
