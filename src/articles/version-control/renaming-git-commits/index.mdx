<Prelude label="The Context and Clean Git History">
  <M>
    Committing without conventions and using unappealing names can pose risks. A
    consistent convention facilitates faster <B>rebase</B>,{" "}
    <B>conflict resolution</B>, <B>squashing</B>, and overall version control.
    Occasional commit renaming becomes necessary when you identify ugly commits.
  </M>
  <M>
    Before delving into technical details, assume we have <B>3 commits</B> with
    unclear names that require rename.

  <XL>Interactive Rebase and Reword</XL>
  <M>
    Execute in the terminal: <B>git rebase -i HEAD~3</B>. This opens an
    interactive tab to specify the commits for renaming. Next, follow the steps
    outlined in the <B>GIF</B> below.

  <M>Now, let's elaborate on what happened.</M>
  <L ordered>
    <Li>We identified multiple commits with poor names - 3x "wip"</Li>
    <Li>
      Executed the interactive rebase command - "git rebase -i HEAD~3" to rename
      the last 3 commits
    </Li>
    <Li>Switched the operation from "pick" to "reword" for each</Li>
    <Li>The interactive mode prompted us for new names for each commit</Li>
    <Li>
      Finally, used "git push --force" to overwrite and push the updated commits
      to origin
    </Li>
  </L>
  <Hint hasBg>
    Keep in mind that when employing <B>git push --force</B>, you replace
    existing commits with new ones, resulting in changed hashes.

<Summary label="Conclusions and thoughts">
  <M>
    Now you know how to rename <B>n commits</B> using the interactive mode. For{" "}
    <B>Git beginners</B> with crucial work on branch, consider cloning the
    branch and experimenting. Every developer has faced <B>Git</B> mishaps in
    their career, so you might not be an exception to the rule. Good luck!
