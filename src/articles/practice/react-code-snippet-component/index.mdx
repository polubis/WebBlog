<Prelude>
  <M>
    Code written by programmers is like a unique signature. We can recognize the
    author by a few lines. So let's create our unique signature by creating a
    flexible component for code snippets.
  </M>
</Prelude>

<Section>
  <XL>1. Library choice</XL>
  <M>
    The most complicated part of the component will be code syntax highlighting.
    It is better to use a battle-tested library like <B>prism</B>. In our case,
    we will use the popular wrapper - <B>prism-react-renderer</B>.
  </M>
  <M>
    The reason is simple - we can easily customize how the component works with{" "}
    <B>props</B>. Below is an example of how you can display a piece of{" "}
    <B>jsx</B> code.
  </M>
  <Snippet
    linesCount={15}
    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polubis/React-code-snippet-component/main/snippets/1.tsx"
  />
  <M>
    The component injects the appropriate styles, and we can customize the
    behavior and appearance to suit our needs.
  </M>
</Section>

<Section>
  <XL>2. Overwriting the theme</XL>
  <M>
    To override the theme we need an array in which we define styles for each
    element.
  </M>
  <Snippet
    linesCount={55}
    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polubis/React-code-snippet-component/main/src/code/setup.ts"
  />
</Section>

<Section>
  <XL>3. Creating Code component</XL>
  <M>
    We need a wrapper for our library. First, let's determine what the{" "}
    <B>props</B> object will look like. We will define the interfaces in a
    separate file for better clarity.
  </M>
  <Snippet
    linesCount={8}
    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polubis/React-code-snippet-component/main/src/code/models.ts"
  />
  <M>Then the component itself.</M>
  <Snippet
    linesCount={45}
    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polubis/React-code-snippet-component/main/src/code/Code.tsx"
  />
  <M>
    We used <B>memo</B> to limit rerenders. Component will update only when code
    snippet changes. All that's left is to overwrite the styles we don't like.
  </M>
  <Snippet
    linesCount={85}
    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polubis/React-code-snippet-component/main/src/code/style.ts"
  />
</Section>

<Section>
  <XL>4. Creating Snippet component</XL>
  <M>
    This component will be responsible for retrieving the content and deciding
    how to pass the parameters. It will use the previously created <B>Code</B>{" "}
    component. As before, let's start with the models.
  </M>
  <Snippet
    linesCount={69}
    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polubis/React-code-snippet-component/main/src/snippet/models.ts"
  />
  <M>
    The created models will be used to implement several components. Each of
    them will have a different role. Let's start with the <B>Snippet</B>{" "}
    component.
  </M>
  <Snippet
    linesCount={17}
    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polubis/React-code-snippet-component/main/src/snippet/Snippet.tsx"
  />
  <M>
    Pay attention to the exception that we <B>throw</B>. We did that because in
    the absence of <B>children</B> and <B>src</B>, our component will not work
    properly.
  </M>
  <M>
    Also noteworthy is the import of the <B>SnippetProps</B> interface from
    another file. Separation of interfaces from implementations can be helpful
    when we want to reuse models in other components. It also changes the way
    how developer thinks. It is a bit like <B>test driven development</B>{" "}
    approach. After all, <B>TypeScript</B> is similar to one big test which
    checks our codebase in real time during compilation.
  </M>
  <Hint hasBg>

    you can read more about <B>TDD</B>.
  </Hint>
</Section>

<Section>
  <XL>5. Implementing StaticSnippet component</XL>
  <M>
    This one will just render code snippet passed as <B>children</B>.
  </M>
  <Snippet
    linesCount={9}
    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polubis/React-code-snippet-component/main/src/snippet/StaticSnippet.tsx"
  />
  <M>
    As before, we added implementation to the prepared model. In that case we
    just wrapped our <B>SnippetContent</B> component. We did this for the sake
    of transparency.
  </M>
</Section>

<Section>
  <XL>6. Creating SnippetContent component</XL>
  <M>
    This component adds the layout, header and description if they are passed.
  </M>
  <Snippet
    linesCount={28}
    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polubis/React-code-snippet-component/main/src/snippet/SnippetContent.tsx"
  />
  <M>
    Next styles. Nothing fancy here. Just some flex and css for <B>header</B>{" "}
    and <B>description</B>.
  </M>
  <Snippet
    linesCount={32}
    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polubis/React-code-snippet-component/main/src/snippet/style.ts"
  />
</Section>

<Section>
  <XL>7. Creating DynamicSnippet component</XL>
  <M>
    We'll use presentation from <B>SnippetContent</B> and models that we created
    before.
  </M>
  <Snippet
    linesCount={76}
    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polubis/React-code-snippet-component/main/src/snippet/DynamicSnippet.tsx"
  />
  <M>What is going on here?</M>
  <List items="ASCII art is generated, We're fetching snippet via src, Code is parsed to text, During retrieve snippet we changing state, When state is pending we return ASCII art instead of code" />
</Section>

<Section>
  <XL>8. Generating ASCII art</XL>
  <M>
    We need to add some dummy characters when there is more lines in code
    snippet than in ASCII art to prevent content size change.
  </M>
  <M>
    Also, when our snippet is smaller than height of ASCII art, we need to
    remove some lines from graphic. Reason is the same - <B>user experience</B>.
  </M>
  <Snippet
    linesCount={126}
    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polubis/React-code-snippet-component/main/src/snippet/ASCII.ts"
  />
</Section>

<Section>
  <XL>9. Usage</XL>
  <M>Just pass correct props and you can customize what you need.</M>
  <Snippet
    linesCount={50}
    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polubis/React-code-snippet-component/main/src/App.tsx"
  />
</Section>

<Example>
  <iframe
    src="https://codesandbox.io/embed/frosty-grass-9tjoqv?fontsize=14&hidenavigation=1&theme=dark"
    style="width:100%; height:500px; border:0; border-radius: 4px; overflow:hidden;"
    title="frosty-grass-9tjoqv"
    allow="accelerometer; ambient-light-sensor; camera; encrypted-media; geolocation; gyroscope; hid; microphone; midi; payment; usb; vr; xr-spatial-tracking"
    sandbox="allow-forms allow-modals allow-popups allow-presentation allow-same-origin allow-scripts"
  ></iframe>
</Example>

<Summary>
  <M>
    Right now you're able to render the code in a cool and fancy way. We checked
    how separation of models can be useful to share type definitions between
    different files.
