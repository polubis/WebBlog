<Prelude>
  <M>
    In the frontend world, you need to practice so that you don't lose
    flexibility in writing code. I like to pick a specific problem and solve it.
    It doesn't have to be big, as long as it's a challenge.
  </M>
  <M>
    I recommend you this approach. It is especially good if you feel stagnant in
    the project or are beginning to program.
  </M>
  <M>
    So let's move on to today's little challenge, in which you will create a
    component for visualizing articles on the timeline and you will call it{" "}
    <B>react timeline component</B>.
  </M>

<Section>
  <XL>1. How react timeline component will work?</XL>
  <M>
    It will be a presentational component to which we will pass data and
    instructions for displaying the elements.
  </M>

</Section>

<Section>
  <XL>2. Legend</XL>
  <M>
    Before you start to work, determine which elements your component will
    consist of. This is helpful later when naming variables.
  </M>
  <Img

    description="Think first then do"
    border
  />
</Section>

<Section>
  <XL>3. Positioning method</XL>
  <M>
    The layout of the component is a bit non-standard. So using a grid or
    flexbox, in this case, will be very difficult or impossible.
  </M>
  <M>
    Use good old <B>position: absolute</B> and <B>transform: translate(a,b)</B>{" "}
    to define the position of the elements.
  </M>
  <M>
    <B>Transform</B> instead of <B>top | right | bottom | left</B> properties
    will guarantee you better animation performance.
  </M>

  <XL>4. Inline styles???</XL>
  <M>
    Why do you use inline styles? First, for code consistency. Most of the
    styles are calculated dynamically, so using class names and inline styles is
    not very consistent.
  </M>
  <M>
    Secondly, snapshots of the tests which you will use later, compare real
    styles, not class names.
  </M>
  <M>
    Lastly, the component will work in any <B>React</B> project without the need
    to install additional packages or attach styles.
  </M>
</Section>

<Section>
  <XL>5. API design</XL>
  <M>Below is an example of the use of your future component.</M>
  <Code
    mode="dynamic"
    lang="tsx"
    linesCount={5}
    description="Clean and compact"
    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polubis/React-timeline-component/main/src/snippets/usage.tsx"
  />
  <M>
    Now you know what your component will accept. It's time to create types for
    data.
  </M>
  <Code
    mode="dynamic"
    lang="ts"
    linesCount={15}
    description="Data shape"
    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polubis/React-timeline-component/main/src/timeline/models/data.ts"
  />
  <M>Now it's time to model the components.</M>
  <Code
    mode="dynamic"
    lang="ts"
    description="Components API"
    linesCount={44}
    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polubis/React-timeline-component/main/src/timeline/models/props.ts"
  />
  <M>
    Your component will also take a <B>setup</B> prop which specifies sizes and
    distances between elements.
  </M>
  <Code
    mode="dynamic"
    lang="ts"
    description="Setup object"
    linesCount={36}
    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polubis/React-timeline-component/main/src/timeline/models/setup.ts"
  />
  <M>
    Finally, an example of an object that you can pass to a component, but it is
    not required. The component will use the default implementation.
  </M>
  <Code
    mode="dynamic"
    lang="ts"
    description="Default setup"
    linesCount={23}
    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polubis/React-timeline-component/main/src/timeline/setup.ts"
  />
</Section>

<Section>
  <XL>5. Generating sample data</XL>
  <M>
    How can you guarantee the convenience of manual component testing? All you
    need to do is to create functions for generating data and create several
    sets for different cases.
  </M>
  <Code
    mode="dynamic"
    lang="ts"
    description="Data sets for testing"
    linesCount={58}
    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polubis/React-timeline-component/main/src/snippets/generator.ts"
  />
  <M>
    Now you can display <B>react timeline component</B> in various
    configurations and test it manually to see if it works as expected.
  </M>
</Section>

<Section>
  <XL>6. Implementing container</XL>
  <M>
    Firstly, we count the maximum number of elements on the top and bottom. This
    is needed for height calculation.
  </M>
  <Code
    mode="dynamic"
    lang="ts"
    description="Counted"
    linesCount={20}
    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polubis/React-timeline-component/main/src/timeline/utils/useCount.ts"
  />
  <M>
    Then you must create a component with 2 simple divs and some base styles.
  </M>
  <Code
    mode="dynamic"
    lang="tsx"
    description="I take care of the content"
    linesCount={27}
    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polubis/React-timeline-component/main/src/timeline/components/Container.tsx"
  />
  <M>
    You calculate the height based on the <B>setup</B> object and the{" "}
    <B>maximum number of elements</B> on the top and bottom. Now you can use the
    created component, which will adjust the height based on the amount of data.
  </M>
  <Code
    mode="dynamic"
    lang="tsx"
    description="Container used"
    linesCount={14}
    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polubis/React-timeline-component/main/src/snippets/container.tsx"
  />
  <Img
    src="/assets/react-timeline-component/container.png"
    description="Container displayed"
    border
  />
</Section>

<Section>
  <XL>7. Implementing lineX</XL>
  <M>
    In this component, you will implement the center line. You need to calculate
    the width of the line and distance from the top.
  </M>
  <Code
    mode="dynamic"
    lang="tsx"
    description="LineX component implementation"
    linesCount={58}
    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polubis/React-timeline-component/main/src/timeline/components/LineX.tsx"
  />
  <M>
    Pay attention to the width and top - it's dynamically calculated like height
    in a container. You used <B>transform</B> to move it from the top.
  </M>
  <Code
    mode="dynamic"
    lang="tsx"
    description="Container and LineX"
    linesCount={17}
    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polubis/React-timeline-component/main/src/snippets/line-x.tsx"
  />
  <Img
    src="/assets/react-timeline-component/lineX.png"
    description="LineX displayed"
    border
  />
</Section>

<Section>
  <XL>8. Implementing markers</XL>
  <M>
    Each marker must have a distance to the left based on the{" "}
    <B>group index, setup object</B> and <B>orientation</B>.
  </M>
  <Code
    mode="dynamic"
    lang="tsx"
    description="Mid marker and edge marker"
    linesCount={77}
    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polubis/React-timeline-component/main/src/timeline/components/Marker.tsx"
  />
  <M>
    Now you need to use the new component in <B>Timeline.tsx</B>. Just use the
    dataset and provide the required information to calculate the position of
    the marker at each iteration.
  </M>
  <Code
    mode="dynamic"
    lang="tsx"
    description="Markers displayed"
    linesCount={29}
    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polubis/React-timeline-component/main/src/snippets/markers.tsx"
  />
  <M>
    In addition, several conditional instructions will allow you to modify what
    is visible.
  </M>
  <Img
    src="/assets/react-timeline-component/markers.png"
    description="With markers"
    border
  />
</Section>

<Section>
  <XL>9. Rendering of the y-line</XL>
  <M>
    Similarly to markers, you must calculate the distance from the left side and
    the top/bottom depending on the orientation.
  </M>
  <M>
    Moreover, you also need the height, which will vary depending on the items
    count in the group.
  </M>
  <Code
    mode="dynamic"
    lang="tsx"
    description="Drawing y-line"
    linesCount={26}
    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polubis/React-timeline-component/main/src/timeline/components/LineY.tsx"
  />
  <M>
    Now use the <B>LineY</B> component in <B>Timeline</B>.
  </M>
  <Code
    mode="dynamic"
    lang="tsx"
    description="Usage"
    linesCount={37}
    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polubis/React-timeline-component/main/src/snippets/line-y.tsx"
  />
  <Img
    src="/assets/react-timeline-component/line-y.png"
    description="It's almost done"
    border
  />
</Section>

<Section>
  <XL>10. Rendering group items</XL>
  <M>
    This is the final step. All you need to do is to create a <B>GroupItem</B>{" "}
    component, which will take care of displaying the <B>avatar</B> and the{" "}
    <B>title</B>.
  </M>
  <M>
    As before, we need to calculate the distances depending on the group/item
    indexes.
  </M>
  <Code
    mode="dynamic"
    lang="tsx"
    description="Grouping items"
    linesCount={57}
    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polubis/React-timeline-component/main/src/timeline/components/GroupItem.tsx"
  />
  <M>
    Now use the <B>GroupItem</B> component in <B>Timeline</B>.
  </M>
  <Code
    mode="dynamic"
    lang="tsx"
    description="Usage"
    linesCount={49}
    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polubis/React-timeline-component/main/src/timeline/Timeline.tsx"
  />
  <M>
    Then use the generated data for testing in the <B>App</B> component.
  </M>
  <Code
    mode="dynamic"
    lang="tsx"
    description="Sandbox prepared"
    linesCount={36}
    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polubis/React-timeline-component/main/src/App.tsx"
  />
  <Img
    src="/assets/react-timeline-component/demo1.gif"
    description="Done!"
    border
  />
</Section>

<Section>
  <XL>Bonus!</XL>
  <M>
    If you'd like to start to refactor or improve performance - you can use{" "}
    <B>jest snapshot testing</B> technique.
  </M>
  <M>
    Just create a file <B>Timeline.test.tsx</B> and add this code.
  </M>
  <Code
    mode="dynamic"
    lang="tsx"
    description="Snapshot testing"
    linesCount={15}
    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polubis/React-timeline-component/main/src/timeline/Timeline.test.tsx"
  />
  <M>
    Then run <B>npm run test</B> which will generate a snapshot file. This file
    is like a "checkpoint" in games. If you change the code, and this change
    affects the styles that are crucial to the operation of this component, you
    will be informed about it.
  </M>
  <Img
    src="/assets/react-timeline-component/snapshots.png"
    description="All works!"
    border
  />
  <Hint hasBg>
    Snapshot tests do not work on <B>codesandbox</B>. Download the repository
    and run it in your <B>IDE</B> to test this mechanism.
