# Test scenario

As a user I want to scroll to top by clicking dedicated button
so that I can return to the top of the page in a fast way

Scenario: Return to the top of the page by clicking dedicated button
Given I am on the main page (or any subpage)
When I am lower than the top of the page
And I click on the dedicated button to scroll up
Then it returns to the top of the page
